Early, Deputy Grand Chamber Registrar,\n\nHaving deliberated in private on  and ,\n\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the lastmentioned date:\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0The case originated in an application (no.\u00a064699/01) against the  lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Italian national, Mr\u00a0Francesco Musci (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on .\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant was represented by Mr V. Tassone, a lawyer practising in San Vito Sullo Ionio () in the proceedings before the Chamber and subsequently by Mr S. de Nigris de Maria, Mr T. Verrilli, Mr\u00a0C. Marcellino, Mr\u00a0A. Nardone and Mr\u00a0V. Collarile, of the Benevento Bar. The Italian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented successively by their Agents, Mr U.\u00a0Leanza and Mr\u00a0I.M.\u00a0Braguglia, and their co-Agents, Mr V. Esposito and Mr\u00a0F.\u00a0Crisafulli, and their deputy co-Agent, Mr\u00a0N. Lettieri.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant alleged that there had been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the length of civil proceedings to which he had been a party. Subsequently, the applicant indicated that he was not complaining of the manner in which the Court of Appeal had calculated the delays but of the derisory amount awarded in damages.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0The application was transmitted to the Court on , when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11).\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0The application was allocated to a Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). Mr V. Zagrebelsky, the judge elected in respect of , withdrew from sitting in the Grand Chamber (Rule 28). The Government accordingly appointed Mr L. Ferrari Bravo to sit as an ad hoc judge in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1).\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0On 22 January 2004 the application was declared admissible by a Chamber of the First Section, composed of Mr C.L. Rozakis, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs F. Tulkens, Mr E. Levits, Mrs\u00a0S.\u00a0Botoucharova, judges, Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, ad hoc judge, and also of Mr\u00a0S. Nielsen, Section Registrar.\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0On 10 November 2004 a Chamber of the same Section, composed of Mr C.L. Rozakis, Mr P. Lorenzen, Mr G. Bonello, Mrs\u00a0F.\u00a0Tulkens, Mrs N. Vaji\u0107, Mrs E. Steiner, judges, Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, ad hoc judge, and also of Mr S. Nielsen, Section Registrar, gave judgment in which it held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0On  the Italian Government requested, in accordance with Article 43 of the Convention and Rule 73, that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber. On  a panel of the Grand Chamber accepted that request.\n\n9.\u00a0\u00a0The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. The President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice the case should be assigned to the same Grand Chamber as the cases of Riccardi Pizzati v. Italy, Giuseppe Mostacciuolo v. Italy (no. 1), Cocchiarella v. Italy, Apicella v. Italy, Ernestina Zullo v. Italy, Giuseppina and Orestina Procaccini v. Italy and Giuseppe Mostacciuolo v. Italy (no. 2) (applications nos. 62361/00, 64705/01, 64886/01, 64890/01, 64897/01, 65075/01 and 65102/01) (Rules 24, 42 \u00a7 2 and 71). To that end the President ordered the parties to form a legal team (see paragraph 2 above).\n\n10.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant and the Government each filed a memorial. In addition, third-party comments were received from the Polish, Czech and Slovak Governments, which had been given leave by the President to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 44 \u00a7 2). The applicant replied to those comments (Rule 44 \u00a7 5).\n\n11.\u00a0\u00a0A hearing took place in public in the Human Rights Building, , on  (Rule 59 \u00a7 3).\n\nThere appeared before the Court:\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0for the respondent Government\nMr\tN. Lettieri, \tdeputy co-Agent; \n\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0for the applicant\nMr\tS. de Nigris de Maria, of the Benevento Bar,\nMr\tT. Verrilli, of the Benevento Bar,\nMr\tC. Marcellino, of the Benevento Bar,\nMr\tA. Nardone, of the Benevento Bar,\nMr\tV. Collarile, of the Benevento Bar, \tCounsel.\n\n\nThe Court heard addresses by Mr S. de Nigris de Maria, Mr T. Verrilli and Mr N. Lettieri, and Mr Lettieri\u2019s replies to judges\u2019 questions.\n\nTHE FACTS\n\nI.\u00a0\u00a0THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\n12.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant was born in 1923 and lives in .\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0The principal proceedings\n\n13.\u00a0\u00a0On  Mr P. brought proceedings against the applicant in the Chiaravalle Centrale Magistrate\u2019s Court for recognition of the existence of a right of way.\n\n14.\u00a0\u00a0Preparation of the case for trial began on  and on that date the Magistrate\u2019s Court appointed an expert. Of the seven hearings listed between  and  three were devoted to organising expert evidence, two to an inspection of the premises by the pretore, two were adjourned by the court of its own motion and one was adjourned because the lawyers were on strike. On  the Magistrate\u2019s Court set the case down for hearing of oral submissions on . On that date the hearing was adjourned to  at the parties\u2019 request. Of the fifteen hearings listed between 2 May 1991 and 4\u00a0June 1997 six were adjourned at the parties\u2019 request, two at the request of the defendant, five by the court of its own motion \u2013 one of which was because the registry had not notified the applicant of the date of the hearing \u2013 one because the applicant had changed lawyer and another one to allow the registry to check that the stamps had duly been affixed to a number of documents in the case file. Judgment was reserved on .\n\n15.\u00a0\u00a0In an order of , which was not made at a hearing, the court declared the case reopened and requested the parties to file documents with the registry. On  the court reserved judgment.\n\n16. In an order of  the court declared the case reopened, noted that the parties had not yet filed the documents requested and adjourned the case to . On that date judgment was reserved.\n\n17.\u00a0\u00a0In a judgment of the same date, the text of which was deposited with the registry on , the Magistrate\u2019s Court granted Mr P.\u2019s application.\n\n18.\u00a0\u00a0On  the applicant appealed to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal. According to information provided by the applicant on 6 June 2005, the first hearing, which was to be held on 22 January 2001, was not held until 10 December 2001 following two adjournments of the court\u2019s own motion and an adjournment of a hearing because the registry had not notified the parties of the hearing date. The parties made their submissions two hearings later, on , and the hearing of final submissions was set down for . That hearing was adjourned to  following the transfer of the judge directing the preparations for trial, then to . On that date judgment was reserved.\n\n19.\u00a0\u00a0In a judgment of , the text of which was deposited with the registry on , the Court of Appeal set aside the first-instance court\u2019s judgment and allowed the applicant\u2019s appeal. According to information provided by the applicant on , as the judgment had not been served the time allowed for appealing to the Court of Cassation was still running.\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0The \u201cPinto\u201d proceedings\n\n20.\u00a0\u00a0On an unspecified date in April 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Salerno Court of Appeal under Law no.\u00a089 of , known as the \u201cPinto Act\u201d, complaining of the length of the above-described proceedings. He requested the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and to order the  to pay compensation for the distress and other non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed 13,000 euros (EUR) in compensation for distress and other non-pecuniary damage, and sought reimbursement of the costs and expenses but did not quantify them.\n\n21.\u00a0\u00a0In a decision of , the text of which was deposited with the registry on , the Court of Appeal found that the length of the proceedings had been excessive. It held as follows:\n\n\u201c\u00a0... [the proceedings], given the manner in which they were conducted, cannot be deemed particularly complex. That said, it should be pointed out that the proceedings gave rise to many hearings, some of which were mere adjournments, and as such unnecessary. With regard to the conduct of the parties, the adjournments they requested or at least agreed to must be attributed to them. They must therefore be deemed responsible for the adjournments requested by one party and which the other parties did not oppose or which were accepted and therefore allowed by the court. ... The fact that the court allowed the parties to exercise ... [through those adjournments] their right to a defence cannot be blamed a posteriori on the public organisation of the service.\n\nThe remaining period does have to be attributed to the conduct of the judicial authorities, however, both regarding the intervals relating to the adjournments of the court\u2019s own motion and the adjournments for reasons relating to investigation measures which took longer than a reasonable time to carry out.\n\nIndeed, when the situation is analysed in accordance with Law no. 89/01 [Pinto], the time that elapsed between the beginning of the proceedings and the end is a central\u00a0factor: in this sense, the fact that the length of the proceedings, which is not attributable to the parties\u2019 conduct, is otherwise determined \u2013 in the sphere of the organisation of the court service and, in general, the services managed by the authorities involved in giving a decision or contributing to the disposal of the proceedings \u2013 by personal or structural factors, such as the shortage of staff when compared with the demands of the workload, does not change the conclusion that this time must be attributed to the State, which has not assigned the resources necessary to dispose of a trial speedily.\n\nAccordingly, on the basis of that analysis the delays attributable to the parties can be quantified at three years and two months at first instance. The proceedings are still pending on appeal but the case has already been referred to the appropriate Chamber for the hearing of final submissions on  and, given that the first hearing was held on , the period can be regarded as falling within the reasonable time-span of two years.\n\nOn that basis, the delays attributable to the organisation of the courts, less the delays attributable to the parties, amount to twelve years and ten months.\n\nMoreover, taking the main thrust of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights as a basis, a reasonable time for the average timescale for the conduct of a case at first instance can prima facie properly be fixed at three years. For proceedings dealt with also on appeal the reasonable length can be fixed at about five years for proceedings whose subject-matter is nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nIn the instant case, therefore, the surplus time must be deemed to be approximately seven years and ten months.\n\nThe reasonable time must accordingly be deemed to have been exceeded in so far as the case was not particularly complex and the delays attributable to the parties have already been taken into account.\n\nFor the rest, the claim for compensation of 13,000 euros appears totally disproportionate and unsupported by evidence. Accordingly, the award must be significantly less.\n\nConsequently, having taken into consideration the parties\u2019 interest in having the proceedings disposed of, as their conduct has shown, the lack of complexity of the case, in the absence of evidence supplied by the parties, and the limited impact of the non-pecuniary damage, the court considers it equitable to award Mr Musci 3,500 euros in damages.\u201d\n\nThe Court of Appeal awarded the applicant EUR\u00a03,500 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. In respect of costs and expenses, the Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had not given particulars of the claim. Having regard to the quantity and quality of the work done by the lawyer, it awarded him only half the sum he had considered due EUR\u00a0516.46 (that is, EUR\u00a0258.23) plus tax. That decision became final by  at the latest. The applicant obtained payment of the amounts due from the authorities on .\n\n22.\u00a0\u00a0In a letter of  the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of his application.\n\n23.\u00a0\tIn a letter of  the applicant informed the Court that he did not intend to appeal to the Court of Cassation because an appeal to that court could only be on points of law.\n\nII.\u00a0\u00a0RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0Law no.\u00a089 of 24 March 2001, known as the \u201cPinto Act\u201d\n\n24.\u00a0\u00a0Award of just satisfaction in the event of a breach of the requirement to dispose of proceedings within a reasonable time and amendment to Article 375 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nJust satisfaction\nSection 2\n\nEntitlement to just satisfaction\n\n\u201c1.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone sustaining pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage as a result of a violation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Law no. 848 of 4 August 1955, on account of a failure to comply with the \u2018reasonable-time\u2019 requirement in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, shall be entitled to just satisfaction.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0In determining whether there has been a violation, the court shall have regard to the complexity of the case and, in the light thereof, the conduct of the parties and of the judge deciding procedural issues, and also the conduct of any authority required to participate in or contribute to the resolution of the case.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The court shall assess the quantum of damage in accordance with Article 2056 of the Civil Code and shall apply the following rules:\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0only damage attributable to the period beyond the reasonable time referred to in subsection 1 may be taken into account;\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0in addition to the payment of a sum of money, reparation for non-pecuniary damage shall be made by giving suitable publicity to the finding of a violation.\u201d\n\nSection 3\n\nProcedure\n\n\u201c1.\u00a0Claims for just satisfaction shall be lodged with the court of appeal in which the judge sits who has jurisdiction under Article 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try cases concerning members of the judiciary in the district where the case in which the violation is alleged to have occurred was decided or discontinued at the merits stage or is still pending.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0The claim shall be made on an application lodged with the registry of the court of appeal by a lawyer holding a special authority containing all the information prescribed by Article 125 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The application shall be made against the Minister of Justice where the alleged violation has taken place in proceedings in the ordinary courts, the Minister of Defence where it has taken place in proceedings before the military courts and the Finance Minister where it has taken place in proceedings before the tax commissioners.

It held that \u201cthe case-law of the  is binding on the Italian courts regarding the application of Law no. 89/2001\u201d.\n\nIn its judgment no. 1340 it affirmed, inter alia, the principle that\n\n\u201cthe court of appeal\u2019s determination of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with section 2 of Law no. 89/2001, although inherently based on equitable principles, must be done in a legally defined framework since reference has to be made to the amounts awarded, in similar cases, by the . Some divergence is permissible, within reason.\u201d\n\n26.\u00a0\u00a0Extracts from the plenary Court of Cassation\u2019s judgment no.\u00a01339 deposited with the registry on \n\n \u201c... 2.- The present application poses the fundamental question of what legal effect must be given \u2013 in implementing the Law of 24 March 2001 no. 89, and in particular in determining the non-pecuniary damage arising out of the breach of the reasonable length of proceedings requirement \u2013 to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, whether considered generally as interpretative guidelines which the said Court has laid down with regard to the consequences of the said violation, or with reference to a specific case in which the European Court has already had occasion to give a judgment on the delay in reaching a decision. ...\n\nAs stipulated in section 2.1 of the said Law, the legal fact which gives rise to the right to the just satisfaction that it provides for is constituted by the \u201cviolation of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified in accordance with the Law of 4 August 1955 no. 848, for failure to comply with the reasonable time referred to in Article 6, paragraph\u00a01 of the Convention.\u201d In other words, Law no. 89/2001 identifies the fact constituting the right to compensation by reference to a specific provision of the European Convention on Human Rights. This Convention instituted a Court (the European Court of Human Rights, with its seat in ) to ensure compliance with the provisions contained therein (Article 19). Accordingly, the competence of the said court to determine, and therefore to interpret, the significance of the said provisions must be recognised.\n\nAs the fact constituting the right conferred by Law no. 89/2001 consists of a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is for the Court of the European Convention on Human Rights to determine all the elements of such a legal fact, which thus ends by being \u201cbrought into conformity\u201d by the Strasbourg Court, whose case-law is binding on the Italian courts in so far as the application of Law no. 89/2001 is concerned.\n\nIt is not necessary therefore to pose the general problem of the relationships between the European Convention on Human Rights and the internal judicial system, which the Advocate-General (Procuratore Generale) has amply discussed in court. Whatever opinion one may have about that controversial issue and therefore about the place of the European Convention on Human Rights in the context of the sources of domestic law, it is certain that the direct implementation in the Italian judicial system of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, established by Law no. 89/2001 (that is, by Article 6 \u00a7 1 in the part relating to \u201creasonable time\u201d), cannot diverge from the interpretation which the European Court gives of the same provision.\n\nThe opposite argument, which would permit a substantial divergence between the application accorded to Law no. 89/2001 in the national system and the interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court to the right to reasonable length of proceedings, would deprive the said Law no. 89/2001 of any justification and cause the Italian State to violate Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which \u2018The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention\u2019 (including the said Article 6, which provides for the right to have a case decided within a reasonable length of time).\n\nThe reason behind the enactment of Law no. 89/2001 was the need to provide a domestic judicial remedy against violations in respect of the duration of proceedings, so as to give effect to the subsidiary character of intervention on the part of the Court of Strasbourg, expressly provided for by the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 35: \u201cthe Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted\u201d). The European system for the protection of human rights is founded on the said principle of subsidiarity. From it derives the duty of the States which have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights to guarantee to individuals the protection of the rights recognised by the European Convention on Human Rights, above all in their own internal order and vis-\u00e0-vis the organs of the national judicial system. And this protection must be \u201ceffective\u201d (Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights), that is, of a kind to remedy the claim without the need for recourse to the .\n\nThe domestic remedy introduced by Law no. 89/2001 did not previously exist in the Italian system, with the consequence that appeals against  in respect of a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights had \u201cclogged\u201d (the term used by rapporteur Follieri in the sitting of the Senate of ) the . The  observed, prior to Law no. 89/2001, that the said failures to comply on the part of  \u201creflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy. This accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention\u201d (see the four judgments of the Court delivered on  in the cases of Bottazzi, Di Mauro, Ferrari and A. P.).\n\nLaw no. 89/2001 constitutes the domestic remedy to which a \u201cvictim of a violation\u201d (as defined by Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights) of Article 6 (failure to comply with the reasonable-time requirement) must have recourse before applying to the European Court to claim the \u201cjust satisfaction\u201d provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which, when the violation exists, is only awarded by the Court \u201cif the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made\u201d. Law no. 89/2001 has therefore allowed the European Court to declare inadmissible applications lodged with it (including before the Act was passed) and aimed at obtaining just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights for the excessive length of proceedings (Brusco v. Italy, decision of 6 September 2001).\n\nThis mechanism for implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and observance of the principle of subsidiarity in respect of interventions of the European Court of Strasbourg does not operate, however, in cases in which the Court holds that the consequences of the established violation of the European Convention on Human Rights have not been redressed by domestic law or that this has been done only \u201cpartially\u201d, because in such an event the said Article 41 provides for the intervention of the European Court to protect the \u201cvictim of the violation\u201d. In such cases an individual application to the  on the basis of Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights is admissible (Scordino and Others v. Italy, decision of ) and the Court acts directly to protect the rights of the victim whom it considers not to have been adequately protected by domestic law.\n\nThe judge of the adequacy or inadequacy of the protection that the victim has had from domestic law is, obviously, the European Court, whose duty it is to apply Article\u00a041 of the European Convention on Human Rights to ascertain whether, in the presence of a violation of a provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, the internal law has been able to fully redress the consequences of this violation.\n\nThe argument whereby, in applying Law no. 89/2001, the Italian court may follow a different interpretation from that which the European Court has given to the provisions of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (violation of which is the fact giving entitlement to the right to compensation attributed by the said national law) implies that the victim of the violation, if he or she receives reparation at national level considered inadequate by the European Court, must obtain the just satisfaction provided for in Article 41 of the European Convention on Human Rights from the latter Court. This would defeat the purpose of the remedy provided for in Italian law by Law no. 89/2001 and entail a violation of the principle of the subsidiarity of the intervention of the .\n\nIt is therefore necessary to concur with the European Court of Human Rights, which, in the above-mentioned decision on the Scordino application (concerning the inadequacy of the protection afforded by the Italian courts in implementing Law no.\u00a089/2001), affirmed that \u201cit follows from the principle of subsidiarity ... that the national courts must, where possible, interpret and apply domestic law in accordance with the Convention\u201d.\n\n ... The preparatory documents of Law no. 89/2001 are even more explicit. In the report concerning the bill of Senator Pinto (proceedings of the Senate no. 3813 of 16\u00a0February 1999) it is affirmed that the compensatory mechanism proposed in the legislative initiative (and then adopted by the Act) secures for the applicant \u201ca protection analogous to that which he or she would receive in the international court\u201d, as the direct reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it possible to transfer to domestic level \u201cthe limits of applicability of the same provision existing at international level, limits which depend essentially on the State and on the development of the case-law of the Strasbourg authorities, especially that of the European Court of Human Rights, whose decisions must therefore guide ... the domestic court in the definition of these limits\u201d.\n\n ... 6. \u2013 The considerations expounded in sections 3-5 of the document refer in general to the importance of the interpretative guidance of the  on the implementation of Law no. 89/2001 with regard to reparation for non-pecuniary damage.\n\nIn this particular instance, however, any possibility for the national court to exclude non-pecuniary damage (despite having found a violation of Article\u00a06 of the European Convention on Human Rights) must be considered as non-existent because such is precluded by the previous decision of the European Court which, with reference to the same proceedings, had already ascertained that the unjustified delay in reaching a decision had had consequences involving non-pecuniary damage for the applicant, which the Court itself redressed for a limited period. From such a decision of the  it follows that, once the national court has ascertained that the violation has continued in the period following that considered in the said decision, the applicant has continued to suffer non-pecuniary damage, which must be compensated for in application of Law no. 89/2001.\n\nIt cannot therefore be maintained \u2013 as the Rome Court of Appeal has done \u2013 that compensation is not due because of the small amounts at stake in the proceedings in question. Such a reason, apart from being rendered immaterial by the fact that the European Court has already ruled that non-pecuniary damage had been sustained because of delay in the same action, is in any case incorrect, because the amount of what is at stake in an action in which non-compliance with reasonable time-limits has been ascertained can never have the effect of excluding non-pecuniary damage, given that the anxiety and distress resulting from the length of the proceedings normally also occur in cases in which the amounts at stake are small; hence this aspect may have the effect of reducing the amount of compensation but not of totally excluding it.\n\n7 \u2013 In conclusion the decision appealed against must be quashed and the case remitted to the Rome Court of Appeal, which, in a different composition, will order payment to the applicant of the non-pecuniary damages payable as a result of the violation of the reasonable-time requirement for the period following 16 April 1996 alone, taking as a reference point payments of the same kind of damages by the European Court of Human Rights, from which it may diverge, but only to a reasonable extent (HR Court, 27 March 2003, Scordino v. Italy)\u201d.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Case-law on the transfer of the right to compensation\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0Judgment of the Court of Cassation no. 17650/02 deposited with the registry on \n\n27.\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Cassation held as follows:\n\n\u201c...Where the victim of unreasonably lengthy proceedings dies prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89 of 2001 [known as the \u201cPinto Act\u201d] this shall preclude a right [to just satisfaction] from arising and passing to the heirs, in accordance with the general rule that a person who has died cannot become entitled to a right conferred by an Act that is passed after their death...\u201d\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0Judgment of the Court of Cassation no. 5264/03 deposited with the registry on \n\n28.\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Cassation judges noted that the right to compensation for a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time derived from the Pinto Act. The mechanism set in place by the European standard did not give applicants a cause of action before the domestic courts. Accordingly, the right to \u201cjust satisfaction\u201d could neither be acquired nor transferred by a person who had already died by the time the Pinto Act came into force. The fact that the deceased had, while alive, lodged an application with the  was not decisive. Section 6 of the Pinto Act did not constitute, as the applicants had maintained, a procedural standard bringing about a transfer of powers from the  to the domestic courts.\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0Order of the Court of Cassation no. 11950/04 deposited with the registry on \n\n29.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, which concerned the possibility or otherwise of transferring to heirs the right to compensation deriving from a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 on account of the length of the proceedings, the First Division of the Court of Cassation referred the case to the full court indicating that there was a conflict between the case-law authorities, that is, between the restrictive approach taken by the Court of Cassation in the earlier judgments regarding heirs and the Pinto Act and the four judgments delivered by the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, on 26 January 2004 to the extent that a less strict interpretation would lead to the conclusion that this right to compensation has existed since Italy ratified the European Convention on 4 August 1955.\n\nd)\u00a0\u00a0Extracts from judgment no.\u00a028507/05 of the plenary Court of Cassation deposited with the registry on \n\n30.\u00a0\u00a0In the case giving rise to the order mentioned above referring the case to the full court (see preceding paragraph), the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, established the following principles, thus preventing any further conflicting decisions being given by the courts:\n\n(i) Law no.\u00a0848 of 4 August 1955, which ratified the Convention and made it enforceable, introduced into domestic legal order the fundamental rights, belonging to the category of rights conferred on the individual by public law, provided for in the first section of the Convention and which correspond to a large extent with those set forth in Article 2 of the Constitution. In that respect the Convention provisions are confirmatory and illustrative. ...\n\n(ii) It is necessary to reiterate the principle that the act giving rise to the right to reparation conferred by domestic law corresponds to a breach of the provision in Article 6 of the Convention, which is immediately applicable in domestic law.\n\nThe distinction between the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, introduced by the European Convention on Human Rights (or even pre-existing as a constitutionally protected value), and the right to equitable reparation, which was allegedly introduced only by the Pinto Act, cannot be allowed in so far as the protection provided by the domestic courts does not depart from that previously offered by the Strasbourg Court, the domestic courts being bound to comply with the case-law of the European Court. ...\n\n(iii) Accordingly, the right to equitable reparation for loss sustained as a result of the unreasonable length of proceedings prior to the entry into force of Law no. 89/2001 must be acknowledged by the domestic courts even in favour of the heirs of a party who introduced the proceedings before that date, subject only to the condition that the claim has not already been lodged with the Strasbourg Court and the Court has not ruled on admissibility. ...\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0Judgment of the Court of Cassation no. 18239/04 deposited with the registry on  concerning the right to compensation of legal entities\n\n31.\u00a0\u00a0This judgment of the Court of Cassation concerned an appeal by the Ministry of Justice challenging the Court of Appeal\u2019s award of non-pecuniary damages to a juristic person. The Court of Cassation referred to the decision reached in the case of Comingersoll v. Portugal [GC], no.\u00a035382/97, ECHR 2000IV and, after referring to the four judgments of the full court delivered on 26 January 2004, found that its own case-law was not in line with the European Court. It held that there was no legal barrier to awarding just satisfaction to \u201cjuristic\u201d persons according to the criteria of the . Accordingly, since the Court of Appeal had correctly decided the case the appeal was dismissed.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Judgment of the Court of Cassation no. 8568/05, deposited with the registry on 23 April 2005, concerning the presumption of non-pecuniary damage\n\n32.\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Cassation made the following observations:\n\n\u00a0\u201c\u00a0... [Whereas] non-pecuniary damage is the normal, albeit not automatic, consequence of a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time, it will be deemed to exist, without it being necessary to specifically prove it (directly or by presumption), on the basis of the objective fact of the breach, on condition that there are no special circumstances indicating the absence of any such damage in the actual case concerned (Cass. A.P.  nos. 1338 and 1339);\n\nthe assessment on an equitable basis of compensation for non-pecuniary damage is subject \u2013 on account of the specific reference in section 2 of Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001 to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ratified by Law no.\u00a0848 of 4 August 1955) \u2013 to compliance with the Convention, in accordance with the judicial interpretation given by the Strasbourg Court (non-compliance with which results in a violation of the law), and must therefore, as far as possible, be commensurate, in substantive and not merely formal terms, with the amounts paid in similar cases by the European Court, it being possible to adduce exceptional circumstances that suggest themselves in the particular case, on condition that they are reasoned, not excessive and not unreasonable (Cass. A.P.  no. 1340); ...\n\na discrepancy in the method of calculation [between the Court\u2019s case-law and section 2 of the Pinto Act] shall not affect the general vocation of Law no. 89 of 2001 to meet the objective of awarding proper compensation for a breach of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (vocation acknowledged by the European Court in, inter alia, a decision of 27 March  Scordino v. Italy (application no. 36813/97)), and accordingly shall not allow any doubt as to the compatibility of that domestic standard with the international commitments entered into by the Italian Republic when ratifying the European Convention and the formal recognition, also at constitutional level, of the principle stated in Article 6 \u00a7 1 of that Convention...\u201d\n\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0OTHER RELEVANT PROVISIONS\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0Third annual report on the excessive length of judicial proceedings in  for 2003 (administrative, civil and criminal justice)\n\n33.\u00a0\u00a0In the report CM/Inf/DH(2004)23, revised on 24 September 2004, the Ministers\u2019 deputies made the following indications regarding an assessment of the Pinto remedy:\n\n\u201c...11.\u00a0\u00a0As regards the domestic remedy introduced in 200 by the \u201cPinto Act\u201d, a number of shortcomings remain, particularly in connection with the effectiveness of the remedy and its application in conformity with the Convention: in particular, the law does not provide yet for the acceleration of pending proceedings. ...\n\n109.\u00a0\u00a0In the framework of its examination of the 1st annual report, the Committee of Ministers expressed concern at the fact that this legislation did not foresee the speeding up of the proceedings and that its application posed a risk of aggravating the backlog of the appeal courts. ...\n\n112.\u00a0\u00a0It should be pointed out that in the framework of its examination of the 2nd annual report, the Committee of Ministers had noted with concern that the Convention had no direct effect and had consequently invited the Italian authorities to intensify their efforts at national level as well as their contacts with the different bodies of the Council of Europe competent in this field. ...\u201d\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Interim Resolution ResDH(2005)114 concerning the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and decisions by the Committee of Ministers in 2183 cases against Italy relating to the excessive length of judicial proceedings\n\n34.\u00a0\u00a0In this interim resolution the Ministers\u2019 deputies indicated as follows:\n\n\u201cThe Committee of Ministers\n\nNoting ...\n\n\u201c...the setting-up of a domestic remedy providing compensation in cases of excessive length of proceedings, adopted in 2001 (the \"Pinto\u201d law), as well as the recent development of the case-law of the Court of cassation, increasing the direct effect of the case-law of the European Court in the Italian legal system, while noting that this remedy still does not enable for acceleration of proceedings so as to grant effective redress to all victims;\n\nStressing that the setting-up of domestic remedies does not dispense states from their general obligation to solve the structural problems underlying violations;\n\nFinding that despite the efforts undertaken, numerous elements still indicate that the solution to the problem will not be found in the near future (as evidenced in particular by the statistical data, the new cases before both domestic courts and the European Court, the information contained in the annual reports submitted by the government to the Committee and in the reports of the Prosecutor General at the Court of cassation); ...\n\nStressing the importance the Convention attaches to the right to fair administration of justice in a democratic society and recalling that the problem of the excessive length of judicial proceedings, by reason of its persistence and extent, constitutes a real danger for the respect of the rule of law in Italy; ...\n\nURGES the Italian authorities to enhance their political commitment and make it their effective priority to meet \u2019s obligation under the Convention and the Court\u2019s judgments, to secure the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time to all persons under \u2019s jurisdiction. ...\u201d\n\nC.\u00a0\u00a0The European Commission for the efficiency of justice (CEPEJ)\n\n35.\u00a0\u00a0The European Commission for the efficiency of justice was set up at the Council of Europe by Resolution Res(2002)12 with the aim of (a) improving the efficiency and the functioning of the justice of member States with a view to ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction can enforce their legal rights effectively, thereby generating increased confidence of the citizens in the justice system and (b) enabling a better implementation of the international legal instruments of the Council of Europe concerning efficiency and fairness of justice.\n\n36.\u00a0\u00a0In its framework programme (CEPEJ (2004) 19 Rev 2 \u00a7 (7) the CEPEJ noted that \u201cthe mechanisms which are limited to compensation are too weak and do not adequately incite the States to modify their operational process, and provide compensation only a posteriori in the event of a proven violation instead of trying to find a solution for the problem of delays.\u201d\n\nTHE LAW\n\nI.\u00a0\u00a0THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0The non-exhaustion of domestic remedies\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0The respondent Government\n\n37.\u00a0\u00a0The Government asked the Court to declare the application inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies and accordingly to reconsider the Chamber\u2019s decision that an appeal to the Court of Cassation on points of law was not a remedy that had to be exhausted. In the Government\u2019s submission, the Court had erred in its decision Scordino v. Italy (dec.), no. 36813/97, ECHR 2003IV) in finding that, as the Court of Cassation had always held that complaints about the amount of compensation related to questions of fact, which fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the lower courts, an appeal on points of law was not a remedy that had to be exhausted Admittedly, the Court of Cassation, which examined points of law, could not superimpose its own assessment of questions relating to the merits or the assessment of the facts and evidence on those of the lower courts. It did, however, have power to find that a decision of the lower courts was inconsistent with the correct interpretation of the law or contained grounds that were illogical or contradictory. In such a case it could set out the applicable legal principle or mark out the broad lines of the correct interpretation and remit the case to the lower court for a fresh assessment of the evidence on the basis of those directions. That submission had, moreover, been confirmed by the four judgments (nos.\u00a01338, 1339, 1340 and 1341) delivered by the plenary Court of Cassation on  (see paragraphs 25 and 26 above).\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant\n\n38.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant submitted that the Government were estopped from raising that question because they had never validly raised it before the Chamber. In any event the Government merely put forward arguments that had already been rejected by the Chamber in the admissibility decision and in its judgment on the merits of the case. He observed that up until the Court of Cassation\u2019s departure from precedent, which had not been until after the decision in Scordino (cited above), the Italian courts had not felt bound by the Court\u2019s case-law referred to by lawyers in appeals and that he was unaware of any judgment of the Court of Cassation prior to that departure from precedent in which it had entertained an appeal based solely on the fact that the amount awarded bore no relation to the amounts awarded by the European Court. He also pointed out that, as far as his case was concerned, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision had become final long before the Court of Cassation\u2019s departure from precedent, and therefore asked the Court to reject the Government\u2019s objection and confirm the judgment of  (see paragraphs 16-18 of the Chamber judgment).\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s assessment\n\n39.\u00a0\u00a0Under Article 1, which provides: \u201cThe High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of this Convention\u201d, the primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention is laid on the national authorities. The machinery of complaint to the Court is thus subsidiary to national systems safeguarding human rights. This subsidiary character is articulated in Articles 13 and 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\n40.\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of Article 35 \u00a7 1, which sets out the rule on exhaustion of domestic remedies, is to afford the Contracting States the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them before those allegations are submitted to the Court (see, among other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no.\u00a025803/94, \u00a7 74, ECHR 1999-V). The rule in Article 35 \u00a7\u00a01 is based on the assumption, reflected in Article 13 (with which it has close affinity), that there is an effective domestic remedy available in respect of the alleged breach of an individual\u2019s Convention rights (see Kud\u0142a v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, \u00a7 152, ECHR 2000XI).\n\n41.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the only remedies which Article\u00a035 of the Convention requires to be exhausted are those that relate to the breaches alleged and at the same time are available and sufficient. The existence of such remedies must be sufficiently certain not only in theory but also in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, inter alia, Vernillo v. France, judgment of 20 February 1991, Series A no. 198, pp.\u00a011-12, \u00a7\u00a027; Dalia v. France, judgment of 19\u00a0February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I, pp.\u00a08788, \u00a7\u00a038; and Mifsud v. France (dec.) [GC], no. 57220/00, ECHR 2002VIII).\n\n42.\u00a0\u00a0By enacting the Pinto Act,  introduced a purely compensatory remedy for cases in which there had been a breach of the reasonable-time principle (see paragraph 24 above). The Court has already held that the remedy before the courts of appeal introduced by the Pinto Act was accessible and that there was no reason to question its effectiveness (see Brusco v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a069789/01, ECHR 2001-IX). Moreover, having regard to the nature of the Pinto Act and the context in which it was passed, the Court went on to find that there were grounds for departing from the general principle that the exhaustion requirement should be assessed with reference to the time at which the application was lodged. That was the case not only in respect of applications lodged after the date on which the Act came into force, but also of those which were already on the Court\u2019s list of cases by that date. It had taken into consideration, among other things, the transitional provision provided for in section 6 of the Pinto Act (see paragraph 24 above), which afforded Italian litigants a genuine opportunity to obtain redress for their grievances at national level for all applications currently pending before the Court that had not yet been declared admissible (see Brusco, ibid.).\n\n43.\u00a0\u00a0In the Scordino case (cited above) the Court held that where applicants complained only of the amount of compensation and the discrepancy between that amount and the amount which would have been awarded under Article 41 of the Convention in just satisfaction, they were not required \u2013 for the purpose of exhausting domestic remedies \u2013 to appeal to the Court of Cassation against the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. The Court based that conclusion on a study of some one hundred Court of Cassation judgments. In none of those judgments had that court entertained a complaint to the effect that the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal was insufficient in relation to the loss alleged or inadequate in the light of the  case-law.\n\n44.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that on  the Court of Cassation, sitting as a full court, quashed four decisions in cases in which the existence or amount of non-pecuniary damage had been disputed. In so doing, it established the principle that \u201cthe court of appeal\u2019s determination of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with section 2 of Law no. 89/2001, although inherently based on equitable principles, must be done in a legally defined framework since reference has to be made to the amounts awarded, in similar cases, by the . Some divergence is permissible, within reason\u201d (see paragraph 25 above).\n\n45.\u00a0\u00a0The Court takes note of that departure from precedent and welcomes the Court of Cassation\u2019s efforts to bring its decisions into line with European case-law. It reiterates, furthermore, having deemed it reasonable to assume that the departure from precedent, in particular judgment no. 1340 of the Court of Cassation, must have been public knowledge from . It has therefore held that, from that date onwards, applicants should be required to avail themselves of that remedy for the purposes of Article 35\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01 de la Convention (see Di Sante v.\u00a0Italy (dec.), no. 56079/00, 24 June 2004, and, mutatis mutandis, Broca and Texier-Micault v. , nos. 27928/02 and 31694/02, \u00a7 20, 21\u00a0October 2003).\n\n46.\u00a0\u00a0In the instant case the Grand Chamber, like the Chamber, notes that the time-limit for appealing to the Court of Cassation had expired before  and considers that, in these circumstances, the applicant was dispensed from the obligation to exhaust domestic remedies. Consequently, without prejudging the question whether the Government can be regarded as estopped from raising this objection, the Court considers that it must be dismissed.\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Assessment of \u201cvictim\u201d status\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0The Chamber decision\n\n47.\u00a0\u00a0In its admissibility decision of 22 January 2004 the Chamber followed the decision in the Scordino case (cited above) according to which an applicant could still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention where the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal was not considered by the Chamber as sufficient to repair the alleged loss and violation. In the present case, as the amount awarded to the applicant was not sufficient to amount to adequate redress the Chamber held that he could still claim to be a victim.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Submissions by those appearing before the Court\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0The Government\n\n48.\u00a0\u00a0The respondent Government submitted that the applicant was no longer a \u201cvictim\u201d of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 because he had obtained from the Court of Appeal a finding of a violation and an amount which should be regarded as adequate having regard to his conduct \u2013 there had been numerous adjournments for no apparent reason \u2013 and must have been aware that his claim was unfounded. The Government also considered that the length of the proceedings had worked to the applicant\u2019s advantage because it had delayed the granting of a right of way to the other party.\n\n49.\u00a0\u00a0The Government took the opportunity to ask the Court to clarify the various aspects of the reasoning that lead to its decisions, both in respect of the parts relating to a violation and regarding just satisfaction. They submitted that the Court should follow the approach used by the domestic courts and explain in each case how many years had to be regarded as \u201cnatural\u201d for each stage of proceedings, how many might be acceptable having regard to the complexity of the case, how many delays were attributable to each party, the importance of the stakes in the proceedings, the outcome of the proceedings and how the just satisfaction to be awarded was calculated on the basis of those factors. They criticised the Chamber for failing to give a detailed examination in its judgment of  of the reasoning of the domestic court. The Chamber had merely asserted that the amount awarded was insufficient without specifying the similarities or differences between the previous cases referred to by way of comparison and the proceedings in question.\n\n50.\u00a0\u00a0In the Government\u2019s submission, the Court had to strike a fair balance between the requirement of clarity and respect for principles such as the States\u2019 margin of appreciation and the subsidiarity principle. The attempt to strike that balance had to be governed by the general rule that any factor to be taken into account which was stated loosely or vaguely in the Strasbourg case-law had to be considered with the greatest respect for the corresponding margin of appreciation to be enjoyed by each State without fear of being subsequently disavowed by the European Court owing to a different perception of a fact or its importance. The Government considered that the acknowledgement of the existence of damage and the determination of quantum were part of the assessment of evidence which fell within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts and was in theory outside the competence of the supranational court. Although the Court did admittedly have the power to review decisions submitted to it with a view to ensuring that the reasoning was neither manifestly unreasonable nor arbitrary and was consonant with logic and the lessons derived from experience actually encountered in the social context, it could not, however, impose its own criteria or substitute its own beliefs for that of the domestic courts in assessing the evidence.\n\n51.\u00a0\u00a0The Government felt it important to explain the criteria used in Italian law and pointed out that the finding of a violation was independent of the existence of non-pecuniary damage. The Court of Cassation had asserted, though, that non-pecuniary damage was a normal consequence of a breach of the reasonable-time requirement that from then on did not have to be proved by the applicant. According to the Court of Cassation, it was up to the State to prove the contrary, that is, provide proof that in a particular case an inordinately long wait for a judgment had not occasioned the applicant any anxiety or distress but had been advantageous or that the applicant had been aware of having instituted or contested proceedings on the basis of erroneous arguments (Court of Cassation 29.3-11.5.2004 no.\u00a08896), for example where they had been well aware from the outset that they had no chance of winning. Furthermore, under Article 41 the Court awarded just satisfaction if such was appropriate, so a finding of a violation could suffice. Accordingly, the Court should not be the only institution able to vary the amounts it awarded to the point of awarding nothing. They reiterated that, under Italian law, it was only the years beyond the reasonable time that had to be taken into account when assessing the damage.\n\n52.\u00a0\u00a0At the hearing the Government indicated that as far as the procedural costs were concerned the applicant had obtained an order from the court for their reimbursement. With regard to the delay in paying the compensation, the Government pointed out that the present case had been communicated only in respect of the length of the civil proceedings and not regarding access to a tribunal on account of the delay in paying the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal. Lastly, referring also to the information provided at the hearing in the Scordino case (no.\u00a036813/97) the same day, the Government explained that as the amount earmarked in the budget in respect of Pinto cases had been insufficient in 2002 and 2003 it had been increased in 2004 and 2005.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Government argued that the applicant should no longer be regarded as a \u201cvictim\u201d of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0The applicant\n\n53.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant, for his part, considered that he was still a \u201cvictim\u201d of the violation in that the amount that had been awarded him by the Court of Appeal was not only derisory but had also been paid late. He also pointed out that all that could be obtained by lodging an application under the Pinto Act was compensation and that it had not in any way expedited the proceedings, which were still pending.\n\n54.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant took this opportunity to point out the other flaws in the Pinto Act to which he had himself been exposed:\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0in the first place, the relevant court of appeal was a long way away from the claimants\u2019 place of residence. For every formality they had to travel , whereas before the Court everything could be done by fax or post;\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0stamp duty and fees for registration in the list of cases had been payable (by decision of the Ministry of Justice \u2013 that is, the respondent \u2013 in a circular sent to the registries) until a decree of ;\n\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0Pinto proceedings were always conditional (whether the applicant won or lost) on the payment of other expenses, including the heavy tax on registering the decision;\n\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0applications had been dealt with at only one level of jurisdiction, without any possibility of appealing to the Court of Cassation in the event of an error of assessment, until the departure from precedent of ;\n\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0consideration of the application in private (camera di consiglio) rather than in ordinary proceedings made it impossible to adduce evidence other than documents, and the court could request further evidence (but was not obliged to do so). The choice of this type of procedure by the legislature was intended to limit as far as possible the amount of compensation for damage by ensuring that the court gave its ruling in the light of the information available;\n\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0the domestic criteria governing compensation for damage were entirely different from those of the Court;\n\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0there was an inequality of treatment regarding the payment of costs and expenses: if the claimant won the amounts awarded by the courts of appeal were minimal, whereas if the claimant lost the amounts payable to the State were much higher.\n\nFurthermore, the Pinto Act provided for payment within the limits of available resources. The funds available (approximately 6,500,000 euros) in 2002 had been ridiculously low given the thousands of applications that had then been pending before the Court. The amounts earmarked were still inadequate today, hence the delay in making payments. Once a decision had been obtained from the Court of Appeal, the State did not spontaneously make payment but obliged the applicants to serve the decision on the authorities, wait the statutory 120 days after service and then take out a writ, and sometimes apply for a garnishee order, which was not always successful because funds might not be available. This meant that, on average, two years elapsed between the date of the decision and the date when the Italian State actually paid the sum to the applicant, which was perfectly legitimate since the Pinto Act itself provided that \u201cpayment shall be within the limits of available resources\u201d, that is, the limits of the \u2013 notoriously inadequate \u2013 sums that the State decided to set aside every year.\n\n55.\u00a0\u00a0In the applicant\u2019s submission, an analysis of the Pinto Act and the Italian courts\u2019 manner of applying it showed that the purpose of the measures taken by the State was not to eliminate the delays but to create a remedy that would be such an obstacle that it would discourage claimants from lodging an application or continuing with one. The applicant was thus not only a victim of the chronic delays in proceedings but also of the subsequent frustrations resulting from the obstacles instituted with the Pinto remedy. Furthermore, the Pinto Act had increased the workload of the courts of appeal without any provision being made for a concomitant substantial increase in the number of judges, which could only have adverse effects on the judges\u2019 work.\n\n56.\u00a0\u00a0In reply to the criticism of the various Governments regarding the criteria articulated by the Chamber, the applicant observed that the length of the proceedings was so bound up with the Italian judicial system that the Government omitted to ask the Court what they should change in the system in order to eliminate the delays. Instead, the Government asked the Court to lay down guidelines regarding damage or authorise the courts to continue using guidelines that were totally different from those used by the Court so that they could carry on running the Italian system without introducing any changes to expedite proceedings. The applicant argued that the Government erred in its assessment of the position as it was not for the European Court of Human Rights to avoid giving judgments that conflicted with national law but, on the contrary, the national law (including the Pinto Act) that should not conflict with the Convention. In the applicant\u2019s submission, the Government could not properly argue that in some cases delays in legal proceedings gave applicants an advantage if they held out with unfounded arguments during proceedings, or if the stakes involved in the dispute were less than the just satisfaction awarded. The value of the application in question was of no relevance to the right to a hearing within a reasonable time and Article 6\u00a0did not require an applicant claiming the right to just satisfaction to have been successful. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s reasoning was one that was expressed with hindsight at the end of proceedings, and it was never possible to say beforehand what the outcome would be. If a case was lost after twenty years of proceedings the non-pecuniary damage incurred was all the greater, since if the person had known earlier that they would lose they would probably have arranged certain aspects of their life differently.\n\n57.\u00a0\u00a0As to the adequacy of a finding of a violation, that assertion held true only for a State that committed few breaches \u2013 and these owing to exceptional circumstances \u2013 and possessed a sound judicial system. This was not the situation in , which did nothing to put an end to these violations. Such conduct certainly could not be rewarded with the elimination of just satisfaction. On the contrary, in order to force the State to take measures to avoid violations the Court ought to increase the awards in its judgments against  until the reasons why justice was not delivered within a reasonable time were eliminated.\n\n58.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the comments relating to the subsidiarity principle, the applicant submitted that Article 13 could not be construed as allowing a State to adopt a domestic remedy which would determine just satisfaction for violations of fundamental rights recognised by the Court according to criteria that were completely different from those used by the Court. The Court therefore had a duty to intervene regarding domestic decisions in order to ensure full reparation of the consequences of violations of the rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. The Court\u2019s intervention was always possible where the domestic courts had made a decision impairing the effectiveness of the domestic remedy. To accept wholesale the \u201csubsidiarity\u201d argument was tantamount to depriving the Court of its function, which was to ensure that the Contracting States applied the Convention and its Protocols.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The intervening parties\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0The Czech Government\n\n59.\u00a0\u00a0In the Czech Government\u2019s submission, the Court should confine itself to ensuring that the consequences of the case-law policy choices made by the domestic courts were in keeping with the Convention. Its review should be more or less rigorous, depending on the margin of appreciation that the Court allowed national authorities. The Court should only ensure that, in accordance with Article 13 of the Convention, the national authorities complied with the principles established in its case-law or applied the provisions of their own domestic law in such a way that applicants enjoyed a level of protection in respect of their rights and freedoms as guaranteed by the Convention that was greater than or equivalent to that which they would enjoy if the national authorities applied the Convention\u2019s provisions directly. The Court should not go any further except in cases where the outcome of action by the national authorities appeared, on the face of it, arbitrary.\n\n60.\u00a0\u00a0The Czech Government acknowledged that the adequacy of the amount awarded at domestic level was one of the criteria of effectiveness of an application for compensation within the meaning of Article 13. However, in view of the wide margin of appreciation that should be available to the Contracting Parties in implementing Article 13, they considered that the Court should subsequently exercise only \u201climited control\u201d, thus restricted to satisfying itself that the national authorities had not made a \u201cmanifest error in assessment\u201d of the non-pecuniary damage caused by the excessive length of judicial proceedings.\n\n61.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, as the Czech Government wanted to provide their country with a compensatory remedy in addition to the existing preventive domestic remedy, they asked the Court to provide as many guidelines as possible in that connection so that they could set in place a remedy which would incontestably be effective.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0The Polish Government\n\n62.\u00a0\u00a0In the Polish Government\u2019s submission, an assessment of the facts of the case with a view to determining whether the \u201creasonable time\u201d had been exceeded was part of the examination of the evidence conducted by the domestic courts. It was therefore debatable to what extent a supranational body could intervene in this process. It was, rather, commonly accepted that in most cases the facts would have been established by the domestic courts and that the Court\u2019s task would be limited to examining whether the Convention had been complied with. The Court\u2019s case-law appeared to be confined to assessing whether the domestic courts\u2019 decisions, given in accordance with domestic procedure previously approved by the Court, had properly applied the general rules to the specific case. In the absence of precise indications for assessing the facts and calculating the amount of compensation, there were no grounds on which to dispute the decisions of the domestic courts. It should be borne in mind in this regard that the domestic courts had a discretion in assessing the facts and evidence.\n\n63.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in the very particular circumstances of some cases the mere finding of a violation sufficed to meet the requirement of an effective remedy and amounted to sufficient redress for the breach. That rule had been clearly established in the Court\u2019s case-law on other Articles of the Convention. In some cases, moreover, the excessive length of the proceedings could be favourable to the parties and compensating them would therefore be extremely questionable.\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0The Slovak Government\n\n64.\u00a0\u00a0In the Slovak Government\u2019s submission, the Court should adopt the same approach as in assessing the fairness of proceedings, a matter in respect of which it considered that its task was not to deal with the factual or legal mistakes allegedly made by the domestic courts unless such mistakes could have resulted in a breach of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention. Moreover, although Article 6 of the Convention guaranteed the right to a fair trial it did not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence or its assessment, which was therefore primarily a matter for regulation under national law by the domestic courts. Accordingly, when examining decisions of domestic courts on the amount of non-pecuniary damages awarded for delays in the proceedings, the Court should leave enough room for the courts\u2019 discretion in this respect since the domestic courts decided on delays in the proceedings on the basis of the same criteria as the Court \u2013 and were in a better position to analyse the causes and consequences and thus to determine the non-pecuniary damage on an equitable basis.\n\n65.\u00a0\u00a0The Slovak Government pointed out that the decisions of the  concerning delays in proceedings were much more detailed than the Court\u2019s decisions. In their submission, the Court should examine the decisions of the domestic courts relating to the amounts awarded for non-pecuniary damage only with regard to whether these decisions were manifestly arbitrary and unfair and not whether the amounts awarded by the Court in similar circumstances were substantially higher. Moreover, the Slovak Government found it logical that the amounts awarded by the domestic courts for protractedness of proceedings were less than the amounts awarded by the Court because injured persons could obtain effective and rapid compensation in their own country without having to bring their case to the international court.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s assessment\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0Reiteration of the context peculiar to length-of-proceedings cases\n\n66.\u00a0\u00a0The Court will begin by responding to the observations of the different Governments regarding the lack of precision in its judgments both in respect of the reasons leading to a finding of a violation and awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\nIt feels it important to point out that the reason why it has been led to rule on so many length-of-proceedings cases is because certain Contracting Parties have for years failed to comply with the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement under Article 6 \u00a7 1 and have not provided for a domestic remedy for this type of complaint.\n\n67.\u00a0\u00a0The situation has worsened on account of the large number of cases coming from certain countries, of which  is one. The Court has already had occasion to stress the serious difficulties it has had as a result of \u2019s inability to resolve the situation. It has expressed itself on the subject in the following terms:\n\n\u201cThe Court next draws attention to the fact that since 25 June 1987, the date of the Capuano v. Italy judgment (Series A no. 119), it has already delivered 65 judgments in which it has found violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 in proceedings exceeding a \u201creasonable time\u201d in the civil courts of the various regions of Italy. Similarly, under former Articles 31 and 32 of the Convention, more than 1,400 reports of the Commission resulted in resolutions by the Committee of Ministers finding  in breach of Article\u00a06 for the same reason.\n\nThe frequency with which violations are found shows that there is an accumulation of identical breaches which are sufficiently numerous to amount not merely to isolated incidents. Such breaches reflect a continuing situation that has not yet been remedied and in respect of which litigants have no domestic remedy.\n\nThis accumulation of breaches accordingly constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention.\u201d\n\n(see Bottazzi v. Italy [GC], no. 34884/97, \u00a7 22, ECHR 1999V; Ferrari v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no. 33440/96, \u00a7 21, ; A.P. v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a035265/97, \u00a7\u00a018, ; and Di Mauro v. Italy [GC], no.\u00a034256/96, \u00a7 23, ECHR 1999V).\n\n68.\u00a0\u00a0Thus the Court, like the Commission, after years of examining the reasons for the delays attributable to the parties under the Italian procedural rules, has had to resolve to standardize its judgments and decisions. This has allowed it to adopt more than 1,000 judgments against  since 1999 in civil length-of-proceedings cases. That approach has made it necessary to establish scales on equitable principles for awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage under Article 41, in order to arrive at equivalent results in similar cases.\n\nAll this has led the Court to award higher levels of compensation than those awarded by the Convention institutions prior to 1999 and ones which may differ from those applied in the event of a finding of other violations. This increase, far from being a punitive measure, was intended to fulfil two purposes. On the one hand it served to encourage States to find their own, universally accessible, solution to the problem and on the other hand it allowed applicants to avoid being penalised for the lack of domestic remedies.\n\n69.\u00a0\u00a0The Court also considers it important to point out that, contrary to the Government\u2019s assertion, the Chamber has not in any way departed from its constant practice either regarding the assessment of the delays or regarding just satisfaction. Concerning the question of exceeding a reasonable time, it reiterates that regard must be had to the circumstances of the case and the criteria laid down in the Court\u2019s case-law, in particular the complexity of the case, the applicant\u2019s conduct and that of the competent authorities, and the importance of what was at stake for the applicant in the dispute (see, among many other authorities, Comingersoll, cited above, \u00a7\u00a019). Furthermore, a closer analysis of the many judgments which post-date Bottazzi will enable the Government to see that there is a clear pattern in the amounts awarded in its judgments, since the amounts differ only in respect of the particular facts of each case.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0Principles established under the Court\u2019s case-law\n\n70.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the observations concerning the subsidiarity principle, also made by the third parties, the Court notes that under Article\u00a034 of the Convention it \u201cmay receive applications from any person ... claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. ...\u201d\n\n71.\u00a0\u00a0The Court reiterates that it falls first to the national authorities to redress any alleged violation of the Convention. In this regard, the question whether an applicant can claim to be a victim of the violation alleged is relevant at all stages of the proceedings under the Convention (see Burdov v. Russia, no. 59498/00, \u00a7 30, ECHR 2002-III).\n\n72.\u00a0\u00a0The Court also reiterates that a decision or measure favourable to the applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a \u201cvictim\u201d unless the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention (see, for example, Eckle v. Germany, judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, p. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 69 et seq.; Amuur v. France, judgment of , Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996III, p. 846, \u00a7 36; Dalban v.  [GC], no. 28114/95, \u00a7 44, ECHR 1999VI; and Jensen v.  (dec.), no. 48470/99, ECHR 2001X).\n\n73.\u00a0\u00a0The issue as to whether a person may still claim to be the victim of an alleged violation of the Convention essentially entails on the part of the Court an ex post facto examination of his or her situation. As it has already held in other length-of-proceedings cases, the question whether he or she has received reparation for the damage caused \u2013 comparable to just satisfaction as provided for under Article 41 of the Convention \u2013 is an important issue. It is the Court\u2019s settled case-law that where the national authorities have found a violation and their decision constitutes appropriate and sufficient redress, the party concerned can no longer claim to be a victim within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention (see Holzinger v.\u00a0Austria (no. 1), no. 23459/94, \u00a7 21, ECHR 2001I).\n\n74.\u00a0\u00a0In so far as the parties appear to link the issue of victim status to the more general question of effectiveness of the remedy and seek guidelines on affording the most effective domestic remedies possible, the Court proposes to address the question in a wider context by giving certain indications as to the characteristics which such a domestic remedy should have, having regard to the fact that, in this type of case, the applicant\u2019s ability to claim to be a victim will depend on the redress which the domestic remedy will have given him or her.\n\n75.\u00a0\u00a0The best solution in absolute terms is indisputably, as in many spheres, prevention. The Court recalls that it has stated on many occasions that Article 6 \u00a7 1 imposes on the Contracting States the duty to organise their judicial systems in such a way that their courts can meet each of its requirements, including the obligation to hear cases within a reasonable time (see, among many other authorities, S\u00fc\u00dfmann v. Germany, judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports 1996IV, p. 1174, \u00a7 55, and Bottazzi, cited above, \u00a7 22). Where the judicial system is deficient in this respect, a remedy designed to expedite the proceedings in order to prevent them from becoming excessively lengthy is the most effective solution Such a remedy offers an undeniable advantage over a remedy affording only compensation since it also prevents a finding of successive violations in respect of the same set of proceedings and does not merely repair the breach a posteriori, as does a compensatory remedy of the type provided for under Italian law for example.\n\n76.\u00a0\u00a0The Court has on many occasions acknowledged that this type of remedy is \u201ceffective\u201d in so far as it allows for an earlier decision by the court concerned (see, among other authorities, Bacchini v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 62915/00, 21 June 2005; Kunz v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 623/02, 21 June 2005; Fehr and Lauterburg v. Switzerland (dec.), no.\u00a0708/02 and 1095/02, 21\u00a0June 2005; Holzinger (no. 1) (cited above, \u00a7 22), Gonzalez Marin v.\u00a0Spain (dec.), no.\u00a039521/98, ECHR 1999VII; and Tom\u00e9 Mota v.\u00a0Portugal (dec.), no.\u00a032082/96, ECHR 1999-IX).\n\n77.\u00a0\u00a0It is also clear that for countries where length-of-proceedings violations already exist, a remedy designed only to expedite the proceedings \u2013 although desirable for the future \u2013 may not be adequate to redress a situation in which it is obvious that the proceedings have already been excessively long.\n\n78.\u00a0\u00a0Different types of remedy may redress the violation appropriately. The Court has already affirmed this in respect of criminal proceedings, where it was satisfied that the length of proceedings had been taken into account when reducing the sentence in an express and measurable manner (see Beck v. Norway, no. 26390/95, \u00a7 27, ).\n\nMoreover, some States, such as Austria, Croatia, Spain, Poland and the Slovak Republic, have understood the situation perfectly by choosing to combine two types of remedy, one designed to expedite the proceedings and the other to afford compensation (see, for example, Holzinger (no. 1), cited above, \u00a7\u00a022; Slavicek v.  (dec.), no. 20862/02, ECHR 2002VII; Fernandez-Molina Gonzalez and Others v.  (dec.), no. 64359/01, ECHR 2002IX; Michalak v. Poland (dec.), no. 24549/03, 1 March 2005; Andr\u00e1\u0161ik and Others v.  (dec.), nos. 57984/00, 60226/00, 60237/00, 60242/00, 60679/00, 60680/00 and 68563/01, ECHR 2002IX).\n\n79.\u00a0\u00a0However, States can also choose to introduce only a compensatory remedy, as  has done, without that remedy being regarded as ineffective (see Mifsud, cited above).\n\n80.\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already had occasion to reiterate in the Kud\u0142a judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7154-55) that, subject to compliance with the requirements of the Convention, the Contracting States are afforded some discretion as to the manner in which they provide individuals with the relief required by Article 13 and conform to their Convention obligation under that provision. It has also stressed the importance of the rules relating to the subsidiarity principle so that individuals are not systematically forced to refer to the Court in  complaints that could otherwise, and in the Court\u2019s opinion more appropriately, have been addressed in the first place within the national legal system.\n\n81.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, where the legislature or the domestic courts have agreed to play their true role by introducing a domestic remedy the Court will clearly have to draw certain conclusions from this. Where a State has made a significant move by introducing a compensatory remedy, the Court must leave a wider margin of appreciation to the State to allow it to organise the remedy in a manner consistent with its own legal system and traditions and consonant with the standard of living in the country concerned. It will, in particular, be easier for the domestic courts to refer to the amounts awarded at domestic level for other types of damage \u2013 personal injury, damage relating to a relative\u2019s death or damage in defamation cases for example \u2013 and rely on their innermost conviction, even if that results in awards of amounts that are lower than those fixed by the Court in similar cases.\n\n82.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with its case-law on the interpretation and application of domestic law, while the Court\u2019s duty, under Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Parties to the Convention, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.\n\nMoreover, it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to interpret and apply domestic law (see Jahn and Others v. Germany [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, \u00a7 86, to be published in ECHR 2005).\n\n83.\u00a0\u00a0The Court is therefore required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention as interpreted in the light of the Court\u2019s case-law. This is especially true where, as the Italian Court of Cassation has quite rightly observed (see paragraph 26 above), the domestic law refers explicitly to the provisions of the Convention. This supervisory role should be easier in respect of States that have effectively incorporated the Convention into their legal system and consider the rules to be directly applicable since the highest courts of these States will normally assume responsibility for enforcing the principles determined by the Court.\n\nAccordingly, a clear error in assessment on the part of the domestic courts may also arise as a result of a misapplication or misinterpretation of the Court\u2019s case-law.\n\n84.\u00a0\u00a0The principle of subsidiarity does not mean renouncing all supervision of the result obtained from using domestic remedies, otherwise the rights guaranteed by Article 6 would be devoid of any substance. In that connection it should be reiterated that the Convention is intended to guarantee not theoretical or illusory rights, but rights that are practical and effective (see Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v.  [GC], no. 42527/98, \u00a7 45, ECHR 2001VIII). This is particularly true for the guarantees enshrined in Article  view of the prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial with all the guarantees under Article 6 (see, mutatis mutandis, Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, cited above, \u00a7\u00a045).\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0Application of the foregoing principles\n\n85.\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the foregoing principles that the Court is required to verify that there has been an acknowledgement, at least in substance, by the authorities of a violation of a right protected by the Convention and whether the redress can be considered as appropriate and sufficient (see, inter alia, Normann v. Denmark (dec.), no. 44704/98, 14 June 2001; Jensen v.\u00a0Denmark (dec.), no. 48470/99, 20 March 2003; and Nardone v. Italy, no.\u00a034368/98, 25 November 2004).\n\ni.\u00a0\u00a0The finding of a violation\n\n86.\u00a0\u00a0The first condition, which is the finding of a violation by the national authorities, is not in issue since if an appeal court were to award damages without having first expressly found a violation, the Court would necessarily conclude that such a finding had been made in substance as, under the Pinto Act, an appeal court cannot make an award unless a reasonable time has been exceeded (see Capogrossi v. Italy (dec.), no.\u00a062253/00, 21 October 2004).\n\nii.\u00a0\u00a0The characteristics of the redress\n\n87.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the second condition, namely, appropriate and sufficient redress, the Court has already indicated that even if a remedy is \u201ceffective\u201d in that it allows for an earlier decision by the courts to which the case has been referred or the aggrieved party is given adequate compensation for the delays that have already occurred, that conclusion applies only on condition that an application for compensation remains itself an effective, adequate and accessible remedy in respect of the excessive length of judicial proceedings (see Mifsud, cited above).\n\nIndeed, it cannot be ruled out that excessive delays in an action for compensation will affect whether the remedy is an adequate one (see Paulino Tomas v.\u00a0Portugal (dec.), no. 58698/00, ECHR 2003VIII; Belinger v. Slovenia, (dec.) no. 42320/98, 2 October 2001; and, mutatis mutandis, \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v.\u00a0Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 156, ECHR 2004XII).\n\n88.\u00a0\u00a0In that connection the Court reiterates its case-law to the effect that the right of access to a tribunal guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention would be illusory if a Contracting State\u2019s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party. Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the \u201ctrial\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 (see, inter alia, Hornsby v. Greece, judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports 1997II, pp. 510-11, \u00a7 40 et seq., and Metaxas v. Greece, no.\u00a08415/02, \u00a7 25, 27 May 2004).\n\n89.\u00a0\u00a0The Court has pointed out in civil length-of-proceedings cases that the enforcement proceedings are the second stage of the proceedings and that the right asserted does not actually become effective until enforcement (see, among other authorities, Di Pede v. Italy and Zappia v. Italy, judgments of 26 September 1996, Reports 1996IV, p. 1384, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a022, 24 and 26, and pp. 1411-12, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 20, 22, and, mutatis mutandis, Silva Pontes v. Portugal, judgment of , Series A no. 286A, p. 14, \u00a7 33).\n\n90.\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also stated that it is inappropriate to require an individual who has obtained judgment against the State at the end of legal proceedings to then bring enforcement proceedings to obtain satisfaction.\u00a0 It follows that the late payment, following enforcement proceedings, of amounts owing to the applicant cannot cure the national authorities\u2019 long-standing failure to comply with a judgment and does not afford adequate redress (see Metaxas, cited above, \u00a7 19, and Karahalios v. Greece, no.\u00a062503/00, \u00a7 23, 11 December 2003). Moreover, some States, such as  and , have even stipulated a date by which payment should be made, namely two and three months respectively (see Andr\u00e1\u0161ik and Others v. Slovakia, and Slavicek v. Croatia, cited above).\n\nThe Court can accept that the authorities need time in which to make payment. However, in respect of a compensatory remedy designed to redress the consequences of excessively lengthy proceedings that period should not generally exceed six months from the date on which the decision awarding compensation becomes enforceable.\n\n91.\u00a0\u00a0As the Court has already reiterated on many occasions, it is not open to a State authority to cite lack of funds as an excuse for not honouring a judgment debt (see, among many other authorities, Burdov, cited above, \u00a7\u00a035).\n\n92.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the more or less summary nature of compensation proceedings, it should be noted that a remedy affording compensation within a reasonable time may well be subject to procedural rules that are not exactly the same as for ordinary applications for damages. It is for each State to determine, on the basis of the rules applicable in its judicial system, which procedure will best meet the criterion of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d, provided that the procedure conforms to the principles of fairness guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention.\n\n93.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the Court finds it reasonable that in this type of proceedings where the State, on account of the poor organisation of its judicial system, forces litigants \u2013 to some extent \u2013 to have recourse to a compensatory remedy, the rules regarding legal costs may be different and thus avoid placing an excessive burden on litigants where their action is justified. It might appear paradoxical that, by imposing various taxes \u2013 payable prior to the lodging of an application or after the decision \u2013 the State takes away with one hand what it has awarded with the other to repair a breach of the Convention. Nor should the costs be excessive and constitute an unreasonable restriction on the right to lodge such an application and thus an infringement of the right of access to a tribunal. On this point the Court notes that in  applicants are reimbursed the court fee payable on lodging a complaint if their complaint is considered justified (see Charzy\u0144ski v. Poland (dec.), no. 15212/03, to be published in ECHR 2005).\n\n94.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding violations of the reasonable-time requirement, one of the characteristics of sufficient redress which may remove a litigant\u2019s victim status relates to the amount awarded as a result of using the domestic remedy. The Court has already had occasion to indicate that an applicant\u2019s victim status may also depend on the amount of compensation awarded at domestic level on the basis of the facts about which he or she complains before the Court (see Normann v. Denmark (dec.), no. 44704/98, , and Jensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark, cited above).\n\n95.\u00a0\u00a0With regard to pecuniary damage, the domestic courts are clearly in a better position to determine the existence and quantum. Moreover, that point was not disputed by the parties or interveners.\n\n96.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding non-pecuniary damage, the Court, like the Italian Court of Cassation (see its judgment no. 8568/05, paragraph 32 above), assumes that there is a strong but rebuttable presumption that excessively long proceedings will occasion non-pecuniary damage. The Court also accepts that, in some cases, the length of proceedings may result in only minimal non-pecuniary damage or no non-pecuniary damage at all (see Nardone, cited above). The domestic courts will then have to justify their decision by giving sufficient reasons.\n\n97.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in the Court\u2019s view, the level of compensation depends on the characteristics and effectiveness of the domestic remedy.\n\n98.\u00a0\u00a0The Court can also perfectly well accept that a State which has introduced a number of remedies, one of which is designed to expedite proceedings and one to afford compensation, will award amounts which \u2013 while being lower than those awarded by the Court \u2013 are not unreasonable, on condition that the relevant decisions, which must be consonant with the legal tradition and the standard of living in the country concerned, are speedy, reasoned and executed very quickly (see Dubjakova v. Slovakia (dec.), no. 67299/01, 10 October 2004).\n\nHowever, where the domestic remedy has not met all the foregoing requirements, it is possible that the threshold in respect of which the amount will still allow a litigant to claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d will be higher.\n\n99.\u00a0\u00a0It is even conceivable that the court determining the amount of compensation will acknowledge its own delay and that accordingly, and in order not to penalise the applicant later, it will award a particularly high amount of compensation in order to make good the further delay.\n\niii.\u00a0\u00a0Application to the present case\n\n100.\u00a0\u00a0The four-month period prescribed by the Pinto Act complies with the requirement of speediness necessary for a remedy to be effective. The only obstacle to this may arise with appeals to the Court of Cassation in respect of which no maximum period for giving a ruling has been fixed. In the instant case the judicial phase lasted from April 2002 to , that is, about eight months, which, even if it exceeds the statutory period, is still reasonable.\n\n101.\u00a0\u00a0However, the Court finds it unacceptable that the applicant had to wait twenty-three months, after the decision was deposited with the registry, before receiving his compensation.\n\n102.\u00a0\u00a0The Court would stress the fact that, in order to be effective, a compensatory remedy must be accompanied by adequate budgetary provision so that effect can be given within six months of their being deposited with the registry to decisions of the courts of appeal awarding compensation, which, in accordance with the Pinto Act, are immediately enforceable (section 3(6) of the Pinto Act \u2013 see paragraph 24 above).\n\n103.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, as regards procedural costs, certain fixed expenses (such as the fee for registering the judicial decision) may significantly hamper the efforts made by applicants to obtain compensation. The Court draws the Government\u2019s attention to these various aspects with a view to eradicating at the source problems that may give rise to further applications.\n\n104.\u00a0\u00a0In assessing the amount of compensation awarded by the court of appeal, the Court considers, on the basis of the material in its possession, what it would have done in the same position for the period taken into account by the domestic court.\n\n105.\u00a0\u00a0According to the documents provided by the Government for the hearing, there is no disproportion in  between the amounts awarded to heirs for non-pecuniary damage in the event of a relative\u2019s death or those awarded for physical injury or in defamation cases and those generally awarded by the Court under Article  length-of-proceedings cases. Accordingly, the level of compensation generally awarded by the courts of appeal in Pinto applications cannot be justified by this type of consideration.\n\n106.\u00a0\u00a0Even if the method of calculation provided for in domestic law does not correspond exactly to the criteria established by the Court, an analysis of the Court\u2019s case-law relating to awards of just satisfaction for excessively lengthy proceedings should enable the courts of appeal to award sums that are not unreasonable in comparison with the awards made by the Court in similar cases.\n\n107.\u00a0\u00a0In the present case, the Court notes that the proceedings were not complex. Even if it shares the Government\u2019s view that the applicant\u2019s conduct contributed to delaying the proceedings, that is not a significant factor justifying a substantial reduction in the compensation. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, reasoned in part, supports this conclusion moreover since, in accordance with the Court\u2019s case-law, it held that despite the adjournments that were not attributable to the State the proceedings had been excessively long. The Court reiterates that the stakes involved in the dispute cannot be assessed with regard only to the final outcome, otherwise proceedings that are still pending would have no value. Regard has to be had to the overall stakes involved in the dispute for the applicant. It would appear that in awarding EUR\u00a03,500 for seven years\u2019 delay, the rate per year is EUR\u00a0500. The Court observes that the amount awarded is approximately 27 % of what it generally awards in similar Italian cases. This factor alone leads to a result which is manifestly unreasonable having regard to its case-law. It will revert to this matter in the context of Article 41 (see paragraph 145 below).\n\n108.\u00a0\u00a0In conclusion, and having regard to the fact that various requirements have not been satisfied, the Court considers that the redress was insufficient. As the second condition \u2013 appropriate and sufficient redress \u2013 has not been fulfilled, the Court considers that the applicant can in the instant case still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d of a breach of the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement.\n\nAccordingly, this objection by the Government must also be dismissed.\n\nII.\u00a0\u00a0ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n\n109.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant complained of a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which provides:\n\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations ..., everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal...\u201d\n\n110.\u00a0\u00a0On  the applicant informed the Court that he was complaining of the derisory amount of damages awarded and on  that the sums had been paid on .\n\n111.\u00a0\u00a0In its judgment, the Chamber found that there had been a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 because the length of the proceedings did not satisfy the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement and that this was another example of the practice referred to in the Bottazzi judgment (see paragraphs 23-24 of the Chamber judgment).\n\n112.\u00a0\u00a0According to the applicant, the Pinto Act had been approved hastily in order to stem the tide of applications against  and the many judgments finding a violation, which had given rise to the finding of a practice in  incompatible with the Convention. By taking some of the judges off court-of-appeal cases to work on Pinto applications, instead of appointing sufficient numbers of new ones, the Government had merely increased the backlog in the courts of appeal. The applicant did not see how that could prevent further violations.\n\n113.\u00a0\u00a0The Government disputed the wording adopted in the Bottazzi judgment (cited above, \u00a7\u00a022) regarding the existence of a \u201cpractice\u201d incompatible with the Convention since in the present case there had not been any tolerance on the part of the State, which had taken numerous measures, including the Pinto Act, to prevent further violations.\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0Period to be considered\n\n114.\u00a0\u00a0The period to be taken into consideration began on  when proceedings were instituted against the applicant in the Chiaravalle Centrale Magistrate\u2019s Court, and were still pending at first instance on , when the Court of Appeal gave judgment. At that date it had therefore already lasted more than sixteen years and four months for two levels of jurisdiction.\n\n115.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that the Court of Appeal assessed the length of proceedings at the date of its decision, namely, . As the proceedings ended on appeal on , a period of more than two years and five months could not be taken into account by the Court of Appeal.\n\n116.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that the Government did not dispute the length taken into consideration by the Chamber. It points out, though, that the six-month period for lodging an application under the Pinto Act does not start to run until the final domestic decision. As the time for appealing to the Court of Cassation has not yet expired, the applicant can still, if he wants to complain of the length of time that has elapsed after the period already examined by the Court of Appeal, go back before a court of appeal seeking application of the new precedent set by the Court of Cassation on 26\u00a0January 2004 (see judgment no. 1339). The remaining period, of more than two years and five months, is sufficient in itself to amount to a second breach of the same set of proceedings (see Rotondi v. Italy, no.\u00a038113/97, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a014-16, 27 April 2000, and S.A.GE.MA S.N.C. v. Italy, no.\u00a040184/98, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a012-14, 27 April 2000). Accordingly, the Court considers that since the applicant can rely on the departure from precedent if he wishes to obtain a second finding of a violation it does not have to examine the domestic proceedings in their entirety but can confine itself to the period that has already been examined by the Court of Appeal (see Gattuso v. Italy, (dec.), no. 24715/04, 18 November 2004).\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Reasonableness of the length of the proceedings\n\n117.\u00a0\u00a0The Court has already reiterated the reasons that led it to conclude in the four judgments against  of  (see Bottazzi, cited above, \u00a7\u00a022; Ferrari, cited above \u00a7\u00a021; A.P., cited above, \u00a7\u00a018; and Di\u00a0Mauro, cited above, \u00a7 23) that there was a practice in  (see paragraph 67 above).\n\n118.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that, as the Government have stressed, a domestic remedy has since been introduced. However, that has not changed the substantive problem, namely, the fact that the length of proceedings in  continues to be excessive. The annual reports of the Committee of Ministers on the excessive length of judicial proceedings in  (see, inter alia, CM/Inf/DH(2004)23 revised, and Interim Resolution ResDH(2005)114) scarcely seem to reflect substantial changes in this area. Like the applicant, the Court does not see how the introduction of the Pinto remedy at domestic level has solved the problem of excessively lengthy proceedings. It has admittedly saved the Court the trouble of finding these violations, but the task has simply been transferred to the courts of appeal, which were already overburdened. Furthermore, given the occasional divergence between the case-law of the Court of Cassation (see paragraphs 25-32 above) and that of the Court, the latter is again required to give a decision as to the existence of such violations.\n\n119.\u00a0\u00a0The Court emphasises once again that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges the Contracting States to organise their legal systems so as to enable the courts to comply with its various requirements. It wishes to reaffirm the importance of administering justice without delays which might jeopardise its effectiveness and credibility (see Bottazzi, cited above, \u00a7 22). \u2019s position in this regard has not changed sufficiently to call into question the conclusion that this accumulation of breaches constitutes a practice that is incompatible with the Convention.\n\n120.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that in the present case the Court of Appeal also found that a reasonable time had been exceeded in respect of the same period as the one taken into consideration by the Court. However, the fact that the \u201cPinto\u201d proceedings, examined as a whole, and particularly the execution stage, did not cause the applicant to lose his \u201cvictim\u201d status constitutes an aggravating circumstance regarding a breach of Article 6 \u00a7 1 for exceeding the reasonable time. The Court will therefore revert to this issue under Article\u00a041.\n\n121.\u00a0\u00a0After examining the facts in the light of the information provided by the parties and the aforementioned practice, and having regard to its case-law on the subject, the Court considers that in the present case the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201creasonable-time\u201d requirement.\n\nAccordingly, there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a01.\n\nIII.\u00a0\u00a0ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 13, 17 AND 34 OF THE CONVENTION\n\n122.\u00a0\u00a0In the pleadings lodged with the Court in 2005 the applicant appeared to consider that Articles 13 and 17 had been breached and asked the Court to find that a Pinto application was not an effective remedy on account of the obstacles it had created and the manner in which it had been applied. He also asked the Court to rule on a possible violation of Article 34 of the Convention since, given the series of obstacles constituted by the Pinto Act that had to be surmounted before an application could be lodged with the Court, it could be considered that there had been an interference with the right of individual application.\n\nThese Articles are worded as follows:\n\nArticle 13\n\n\u201cEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\u201d\n\nArticle 17\n\n\u201cNothing in [the] Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.\u201d\n\nArticle 34\n\n\u201cThe Court may receive applications from any person, non-governmental organisation or group of individuals claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the Protocols thereto. The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.\u201d\n\n123.\u00a0\u00a0On the assumption that the arguments put forward can be regarded as new complaints under Articles 13, 17 and 34 and are not only grounds in support of submissions under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the Court notes that they were raised for the first time before it in the pleadings submitted to the Grand Chamber in 2005. Consequently, they are not covered by the admissibility decision of  which marks out the limits within which the Court must place itself (see, among other authorities, mutatis mutandis, Assanidz\u00e9 v. Georgia [GC], no.\u00a071503/01, \u00a7\u00a0162, ECHR 2004-II). It follows that these complaints are outside the scope of examination of the case as it has been referred to the Grand Chamber.\n\nIV.\u00a0\u00a0APPLICATION OF ARTICLES 46 AND 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0Article 46 of the Convention\n\n124.\u00a0\u00a0Under this provision:\n\n\u201c1.\u00a0\u00a0The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0The final judgment of the Court shall be transmitted to the Committee of Ministers, which shall supervise its execution.\u201d\n\n125.\u00a0\u00a0The Court reiterates that in the context of the execution of judgments in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, a judgment in which it finds a breach of the Convention imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation under that provision to put an end to the breach and to make reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach. If, on the other hand, national law does not allow \u2013 or allows only partial \u2013 reparation to be made for the consequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfaction as appears to it to be appropriate. It follows, inter alia, that a judgment in which the Court finds a violation of the Convention or its Protocols imposes on the respondent State a legal obligation not just to pay those concerned the sums awarded by way of just satisfaction, but also to choose, subject to supervision by the Committee of Ministers, the general and/or, if appropriate, individual measures to be adopted in its domestic legal order to put an end to the violation found by the Court and make all feasible reparation for its consequences in such a way as to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach (see Assanidz\u00e9 v. Georgia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a0\u00a0198, and Ila\u015fcu and Others v.\u00a0Moldova and Russia [GC], no.\u00a048787/99, \u00a7 487, ECHR 2004-VII).\n\n126.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, it follows from the Convention, and from Article  particular, that in ratifying the Convention the Contracting States undertake to ensure that their domestic legislation is compatible with it (see Maestri v.\u00a0Italy [GC], no.\u00a039748/98, \u00a7 47, ECHR 2004-I).\n\n127.\u00a0\u00a0Hundreds of cases are currently pending before the Court in respect of awards made by the courts of appeal in \u201cPinto\u201d proceedings prior to the Court of Cassation\u2019s departure from precedent and/or the delay in payment of the amounts in question. The Court, while acknowledging with satisfaction the favourable developments in Italian case-law, and particularly the recent judgment of the plenary Court of Cassation (see paragraph 30 above), regrets to observe that where a deficiency that has given rise to a violation has been put right, another one related to the first one appears: in the present case the delay in executing decisions. It cannot over-emphasise the fact that States must equip themselves with the means necessary and adequate to ensure that all the conditions for providing effective justice are guaranteed.\n\n128.\u00a0\u00a0In its Recommendation of 12\u00a0May 2004 (Rec. (2004)6) the Committee of Ministers welcomed the fact that the Convention had now become an integral part of the domestic legal order of all States Parties while recommending that member States ensure that domestic remedies existed and were effective. In that connection the Court feels it important to stress that although the existence of a remedy is necessary, it is not in itself sufficient. The domestic courts must be able, under domestic law, to apply the European case-law directly and their knowledge of this case-law has to be facilitated by the State in question. The Court refers in this regard to the contents of the Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers on the publication and dissemination in the member states of the text of the European Convention on Human Rights and of the case-law of the Court (Rec (2002)13) of 18 December 2002) and on the European Convention on Human Rights in university education and professional training (Rec\u00a0(2004)4) of 12 May 2004), not forgetting the Resolution of the Committee of Ministers (Res (2002)12) setting up the CEPEJ (see paragraphs 35-36 above) and the fact that at the Warsaw Summit in May 2005 the Heads of State and Governments of the member States decided to develop the evaluation and assistance functions of the CEPEJ.\n\nIn the same Recommendation of  (Rec. (2004)6) the Committee of Ministers also reiterated that the States had the general obligation to solve the problems underlying violations found.\n\n129.\u00a0\u00a0The Court reiterates that, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court\u2019s judgment (see Broniowski v. Poland [GC], no.\u00a031443/96, \u00a7 192, ECHR 2004-V).\n\n130.\u00a0\u00a0Without seeking to determine what measures may be taken by the respondent State in order to comply with its obligations under Article 46 of the Convention, the Court would draw its attention to the conditions indicated above (see paragraphs 70-108) regarding the possibility for a person to still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d in this type of case and invite it to take all measures necessary to ensure that the domestic decisions are not only in conformity with the case-law of this Court but also executed within six months of being deposited with the registry.\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Article 41 of the Convention\n\n131.\u00a0\u00a0Article 41 of the Convention provides:\n\n\u201cIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\u201d\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0The Chamber judgment\n\n132.\u00a0\u00a0In its judgment the Chamber gave an indication of the method of calculation used by the Court in determining an equitable assessment of the non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the length of civil proceedings and the possibility of reducing that sum on account of the existence of a domestic remedy (see paragraph 27 of the judgment).\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Submissions by those appearing before the Court\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0The respondent Government\n\n133.\u00a0\u00a0The Government submitted that the judgment of  represented a departure from the Court\u2019s settled case-law and asked it to revert to its previous practice, which conformed to Convention principles. They noted that the criteria established were imprecise, particularly regarding the possibilities of reducing the amounts initially obtained. In their submission, the amount of just satisfaction should be calculated only by reference to the delays attributable to the State.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0The applicant\n\n134.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant referred to the considerable difference in standard of living between the third-party States and  and submitted that the level of compensation could not therefore be the same. He noted that compensation served as a coercive measure against non-complying States that were bound by their undertaking under Article 1 of the Convention to respect the fundamental rights and liberties recognised by the Convention. In his submission, a richer State could properly be ordered to pay higher amounts than those required from poorer ones in order to encourage it to remedy its judicial system, particularly where the State in question was found to have committed the same type of violations for dozens of years in respect of thousands of cases. He noted that the criteria established in the judgment in question had merely revealed the criteria that had been applied for a very long time by the Court and were perfectly compatible with the standard of living of Italian citizens. He stated that Italian lawyers, who had access to the judgments in French or English \u2013 for want of an Italian version \u2013 had already succeeded in deducing from the Court\u2019s judgments all the criteria now being disputed by the Government. He submitted further that the Court could not be expected to draw up an exhaustive list of all the possibilities of reducing or increasing awards. He argued, lastly, that it was down to the domestic courts to consult the Court\u2019s case-law in order to find the Court\u2019s response to a given situation.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The intervening parties\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0The Czech Government\n\n135.\u00a0\u00a0As the Czech Government had decided, in addition to introducing a preventive remedy, to enact a law providing for a compensatory remedy, they felt obliged to propose a law that would be sufficiently foreseeable. They referred to difficulties in that regard, submitting that neither the Convention nor the Court\u2019s case-law provided sufficient clarification. They requested more information about the criteria used by the Court, cases that could be regarded as \u201csimilar\u201d and the threshold level of the \u201creasonable\u201d relation.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0The Polish Government\n\n136.\u00a0\u00a0In the Polish Government\u2019s submission, the Court should indicate what just satisfaction consisted of. If precise indications were not given, inconsistencies were likely to arise between domestic case-law and the Court\u2019s case-law. Applicants and Governments alike would find it very difficult to establish general rules concerning just satisfaction from the Court\u2019s case-law. Accordingly, the domestic courts were not in a position to rely on the Court\u2019s case-law and make decisions compatible with it.\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0The Slovak Government\n\n137.\u00a0\u00a0The Slovak Government appreciated the attempt made by the Court to specify the criteria for determining awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage. However, they added that the considerations on which the Court based its determination of non-pecuniary damage should form part of the reasons for its decision. It was only in that way that the Court\u2019s judgments would become clear instructions for the domestic courts, which determined awards in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by delays in the proceedings. In the Slovak Government\u2019s submission, it was impossible to translate into figures all these aspects or to foresee every situation that might arise. The Court was not expected to define a precise formula by which the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage flowing from the protractedness of proceedings could be calculated or to determine precise amounts. It was, in their view, more important that the Court gave sufficient justification in its decisions for the manner in which the criteria to which regard was had when assessing the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings were then taken into account to determine the amount awarded for non-pecuniary damage arising from the delays in the proceedings. It was clear from the foregoing that applicants should be awarded the same amount in comparable cases.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0The Court\u2019s criteria\n\n138.\u00a0\u00a0In reply to the Governments, the Court states at the outset that by \u201csimilar cases\u201d it means any two sets of proceedings that have lasted for the same number of years, for an identical number of levels of jurisdiction, with stakes of equivalent importance, much the same conduct on the part of the applicant and in respect of the same country.\n\nMoreover, it shares the Slovak Government\u2019s view that it would be impossible and impracticable to try to provide a list of detailed explanations covering every eventuality and considers that all the necessary elements can be found in its previous decisions available in the Court\u2019s case-law database.\n\n139.\u00a0\u00a0It indicates next that the amount it will award in respect of non-pecuniary damage may be less than that indicated in its case-law where the applicant has already obtained a finding of a violation at domestic level and compensation by using a domestic remedy. Apart from the fact that the existence of a domestic remedy is fully in keeping with the subsidiarity principle embodied in the Convention, such a remedy is closer and more accessible than an application to the Court, is faster and is processed in the applicant\u2019s own language; it thus offers advantages that need to be taken into consideration (see paragraph 27 of the Chamber judgment).\n\n140.\u00a0\u00a0The Court considers, however, that where an applicant can still claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d after exhausting that domestic remedy he or she must be awarded the difference between the amount obtained from the court of appeal and an amount that would not have been regarded as manifestly unreasonable compared with the amount awarded by the Court if it had been awarded by the court of appeal and paid speedily.\n\n141.\u00a0\u00a0Applicants should also be awarded an amount in respect of stages of the proceedings that may not have been taken into account by the domestic courts in the reference period where they can no longer take the case back before the court of appeal seeking application of the change of position adopted by the Court of Cassation on 26 January 2004 (see its judgment no.\u00a01339, paragraph\u00a026 above) or the remaining length was not in itself sufficiently long to be regarded as amounting to a second violation in respect of the same proceedings.\n\n142.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the fact that an applicant who, in order to comply with the decision adopted in the Brusco case (cited above), had endeavoured to use the new domestic remedy by applying to the court of appeal after lodging an application with the Commission, has then had to endure a further delay while waiting for payment of a sum due from the State will lead the Court to order the Government to pay the applicant a further sum in respect of those months of frustration.\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0Application of the foregoing criteria to the instant case\n\na)\u00a0\u00a0Damage\n\n143.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant claimed EUR\u00a013,500 for non-pecuniary damage.\n\n144.\u00a0\u00a0The Government submitted that the finding of a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction.\n\n145.\u00a0\u00a0The Court finds that on the basis of the circumstances of the present case (see paragraphs 107 and 114-16 above) it would have awarded, in the absence of domestic remedies, the sum of EUR 13,000. It notes that the applicant was awarded EUR 3,500 by the Court of Appeal, which is approximately 27% of what the Court would have awarded him. In the Court\u2019s view, this factor in itself leads to a result that is manifestly unreasonable in the light of the criteria established in its case-law.\n\nHaving regard to the characteristics of the domestic remedy chosen by  and the fact that, notwithstanding this national remedy, the Court has found a violation, it considers, ruling on an equitable basis, that the applicant should be awarded EUR 2,400.\n\nTo that amount should be added EUR 1,700 for the further frustration arising from the delay in paying the amount due from the State, which was not paid until .\n\n146.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the applicant is entitled to compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the sum of EUR 4,100, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.\n\nb)\u00a0\u00a0Costs and expenses\n\n147.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant also claimed EUR 3,600, plus 2 % CPA (contribution to the lawyers\u2019 insurance fund) and 20 % VAT (value-added tax) for the costs and expenses incurred in the domestic courts for the \u201cPinto\u201d proceedings and for those incurred before the Court, but did not quantify them. He left it to the Court\u2019s discretion to award an unquantified sum for the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the Grand Chamber, with a portion of that sum being payable by the third-party Governments for the drafting of memorials in reply to their observations. Referring to the judgment of Scozzari and Giunta v. Italy ([GC], nos.\u00a039221/98 and 41963/98, \u00a7\u00a7 255-58, ECHR 2000VIII), the lawyers of the defence team also requested that the fees be paid directly to them.\n\n148.\u00a0\u00a0The Government did not express a view on that claim.\n\n149.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding the claim against the third-party Governments, the Court reiterates that the present case is directed only against  and that it is only in respect of that country that it has found a violation of the Convention. Accordingly, any request for an order against another country for the reimbursement of costs and expenses must be rejected.\n\n150.\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, according to the Court\u2019s case-law, an award can be made in respect of costs and expenses only in so far as they have been actually and necessarily incurred by the applicant and are reasonable as to quantum. With regard to the \u201cPinto\u201d proceedings, the Court notes that the domestic court made a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the work done by the lawyer and stressed the fact that he had not provided a breakdown of his claims. The Court notes that the applicant also omitted to itemise particulars of all his claims and provide the necessary supporting documents as required by Rule 60 of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, it decides to make no award under this head. Regarding the proceedings before the Court, given that a legal team was formed for the various cases being examined concurrently (see paragraph 9 above), the Court considers that the case is distinguishable from the case of Scozzari (cited above) and that the claim by the lawyers of the defence team should not be granted. In the present case, having regard to the evidence before it, the above-mentioned criteria and the length and complexity of the proceedings before the Court, it considers that the amount awarded by the Chamber should be confirmed for the proceedings before it, that is, EUR 2,000, and the applicant awarded EUR\u00a03,000 for the work done before the Grand Chamber, that is, a total sum of EUR 5,000, plus any tax that may be chargeable on that amount.\n\nc)\u00a0\u00a0Default interest\n\n151.\u00a0\u00a0The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Dismisses the Government\u2019s preliminary objection as to the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies;\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Holds that the applicant can claim to be a \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of Article 34 of the Convention;\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0Holds that there has been a violation of Article\u00a06 \u00a7 1 of the Convention;\n\n4.\tHolds that the other complaints under Articles 13, 17 and 34 of the Convention fall outside the scope of its examination;\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0Holds\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months, the following amounts:\n\n(i)\u00a0\u00a0EUR 4,100 (four thousand one hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage;\n\n(ii)\u00a0\u00a0EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros) in respect of costs and expenses;\n\n(iii)\u00a0\u00a0any tax that may be chargeable on the above amounts;\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0Dismisses the remainder of the applicant\u2019s claim for just satisfaction.\n\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, , on .\n\n\t\tLuzius Wildhaber\n\t\tPresident\n\t    T.L.
