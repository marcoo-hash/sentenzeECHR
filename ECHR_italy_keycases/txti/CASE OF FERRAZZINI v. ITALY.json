{"text": "CASE OF FERRAZZINI v. ITALY\n\n(Application no. 44759/98)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nSTRASBOURG\n\n12 July 2001\n\nIn the case of Ferrazzini v. Italy,\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting as a Grand Chamber composed of the following judges:\n\n\tMr\tL. Wildhaber, President,\n\tMrs\tE. Palm,\n\tMr\tC.L. Rozakis,\n\tMr\tG.

Mahoney, Registrar,\n\nHaving deliberated in private on 28 March and 13 June 2001,\n\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0The case originated in an application (no. 44759/98) against the Italian Republic lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) under former Article 25 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\u201cthe Convention\u201d) by an Italian national, Mr Giorgio Ferrazzini (\u201cthe applicant\u201d), on 26\u00a0February 1998.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0The Italian Government (\u201cthe Government\u201d) were represented by their Agent, Mr U. Leanza, and by their Co-Agent, Mr V. Esposito. \n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant alleged that there had been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the length of three sets of tax proceedings to which he was a party. He also complained of a violation of Article 14 on the ground that he had been \u201cpersecuted by the Italian courts\u201d.\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0The application was transmitted to the Court on 1 November 1998, when Protocol No. 11 to the Convention came into force (Article 5 \u00a7 2 of Protocol No. 11). \n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0The application was allocated to the Second Section of the Court (Rule 52 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court). On 18 May 2000 a Chamber of that Section, composed of the following judges: Mr C.L. Rozakis, \nMr A.B. Baka, Mr B. Conforti, Mr G. Bonello, Mr M. Fischbach, \nMr E. Levits, Mr P. Lorenzen, and also of Mr E. Fribergh, Section Registrar, relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber, neither of the parties having objected to relinquishment (Article 30 of the Convention and Rule 72). \n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0The composition of the Grand Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 27 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Convention and Rule 24. Following the departure of Mr Conforti, the judge elected in respect of Italy (Rule 28), the Government appointed Mr L. Ferrari Bravo, the judge elected in respect of San Marino, to sit in his place (Article 27 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 29 \u00a7 1). \n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant and the Government each filed written observations on the admissibility and merits of the case. The Grand Chamber decided, after consulting the parties, that no hearing was required (Rule 54 \u00a7 4). \n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0On 28 March 2001 the Court, considering that the complaint based on Article 6 was admissible, decided, under Article 29 \u00a7 3 of the Convention, to take a decision on the admissibility and merits of the application at the same time. \n\nTHE FACTS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\n9.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant is an Italian citizen, born in 1947 and living in Oristano (Italy).\n\n10.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant and another person transferred land, property and a sum of money to a limited liability company, A., which the applicant had just formed and of which he owned \u2013 directly and indirectly \u2013 almost the entire share capital and was the representative. The company, whose object was organising farm holidays for tourists (agriturismo), applied to the tax authorities for a reduction in the applicable rate of certain taxes payable on the above-mentioned transfer of property, in accordance with a statute which it deemed applicable, and paid the sum it considered due.\n\n11.\u00a0\u00a0The present case concerns three sets of proceedings. The first concerned in particular the payment of capital-gains tax (INVIM, imposta sull\u2019incremento di valore immobiliare) and the two others the applicable \nrate of stamp duty, mortgage-registry tax and capital-transfer tax (imposta di registro, ipotecaria e voltura), and the application of a reduction in the rate.\n\n12.\u00a0\u00a0In the first set of proceedings, the tax authorities served a supplementary tax assessment on the applicant on 31 August 1987 on the ground that the property transferred to the company had been incorrectly valued. They requested payment of an aggregate sum of 43,624,700 Italian lire comprising the tax due and penalties. On 14 January 1988 the applicant applied to the Oristano District Tax Commission for the supplementary tax assessment to be set aside.\n\nIn a letter of 7 February 1998 the District Tax Commission informed the applicant that a hearing had been listed for 21 March 1998. In the meantime, on 23 February 1998, the tax authorities informed the commission that they accepted the applicant\u2019s comments and requested the case to be struck out of the list.\n\nIn a decision of 21 March 1998, the text of which was deposited on \n4 April 1998, the District Tax Commission struck the case out of the list.\n\n13.\u00a0\u00a0In the other two sets of proceedings, the tax authorities served two supplementary tax assessments on A. on 16 November 1987 on the ground that the company was ineligible for the reduced rate of tax to which it had referred. The tax authorities\u2019 note stated that the company would be liable to an administrative penalty of 20% of the amounts requested if payment was not made within sixty days.\n\nOn 15 January 1988 the applicant, acting in his own right, although the matter concerned the company A., lodged two applications with the Oristano District Tax Commission for the above-mentioned supplementary tax assessments to be set aside.\n\nIn two letters of 20 March 1998 the District Tax Commission informed the applicant, in his capacity as representative of A., that a hearing had been listed for 9 May 1998 in the two other cases. In two orders of that date the District Tax Commission adjourned the cases sine die and gave the applicant thirty days in which to appoint a lawyer. Subsequently, a hearing was listed for 24 April 1999.\n\nIn two decisions of 22 May 1999, the text of which was deposited at the registry on 16 July 1999, the District Tax Commission dismissed A.\u2019s applications on the ground that the transferred property, which included, among other things, a swimming pool and a tennis court, could not be regarded as the normal assets of an agricultural company.\n\nOn 27 October 2000 A. lodged an appeal with the Regional Tax Commission.\n\n\nTHE LAW\n\nI.\u00a0\u00a0THE COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 6 \u00a7 1 OF THE CONVENTION\n\n14.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant alleged that the length of the proceedings had exceeded a \u201creasonable time\u201d contrary to Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the relevant part of which provides:\n\n\u201cIn the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [a] ... tribunal ...\u201d\n\n15.\u00a0\u00a0In respect of the first set of proceedings, the period to be considered began on 14 January 1988 and ended on 4 April 1998. It therefore lasted more than ten years and two months for a single level of jurisdiction.\n\nIn respect of the other sets of proceedings, the period to be considered began on 15 January 1988 and, since the proceedings were still pending as at 27 October 2000, has therefore lasted more than twelve years and nine months for two levels of jurisdiction.\n\nA.\u00a0\u00a0Admissibility of the complaint based on Article 6 \u00a7 1\n\n16.\u00a0\u00a0The Government submitted that this complaint should be declared inadmissible within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention because Article 6 \u00a7 1 did not apply to disputes relating to tax proceedings. In their submission, the proceedings in question did not relate to \u201ca criminal charge\u201d. They pointed out that in Italy enforcement of the tax courts\u2019 judgments was effected according to the procedure used to enforce civil obligations. The amount payable by the applicant could not be converted into a custodial sentence. Only enforcement measures, such as the seizure and possible sale of the debtor\u2019s assets, were available. In respect of the \u201ccivil\u201d aspect, the Government pointed out that, in accordance with the established case-law of the Convention institutions, taxation matters concerned only public law. \n\n17.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant, for his part, agreed with the Government that the proceedings in question were not criminal. He emphasised, however, the financial aspect of the proceedings, which accordingly concerned a \u201ccivil right\u201d.\n\n18.\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that both parties acknowledged that Article 6 did not apply under its criminal head. In respect of the civil head, and despite the existence of the established case-law referred to by the Government, the Court considers that the complaint raises questions of law which are sufficiently complex not to be susceptible of being resolved at the admissibility stage. Accordingly, the determination of this complaint, including the question, raised by the Government, of the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, depends on an examination of the merits.\n\n19.\u00a0\u00a0That being so, this complaint cannot be declared inadmissible on the ground that it is incompatible ratione materiae with the provisions of the Convention. The Court notes further that no other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established and that it must therefore be declared admissible.\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0Applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1\n\n20.\u00a0\u00a0The parties having agreed that a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d was not in issue, and the Court, for its part, not perceiving any \u201ccriminal connotation\u201d in the instant case (see, a contrario, Bendenoun v. France, judgment of \n24 February 1994, Series A no. 284, p. 20, \u00a7 47), it remains to be examined whether the proceedings in question did or did not concern the \u201cdetermination of civil rights and obligations\u201d. \n\n21.\u00a0\u00a0The Government argued that Article 6 was inapplicable to the proceedings in question, considering that they did not concern a \u201ccivil right\u201d. The existence of an individual\u2019s tax obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the State belonged, in their submission, exclusively to the realm of public law. That obligation was part of the civic duties imposed in a democratic society and the purpose of the specific provisions of public law was to support national economic policy. \n\n22.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant, for his part, stressed the pecuniary aspect of his claims and contended that the proceedings accordingly concerned \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d.\n\n23.\u00a0\u00a0As it is common ground that there was a \u201cdispute\u201d (contestation), the Court\u2019s task is confined to determining whether it was over \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d. \n\n24.\u00a0\u00a0According to the Court\u2019s case-law, the concept of \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d cannot be interpreted solely by reference to the domestic law of the respondent State. The Court has on several occasions affirmed the principle that this concept is \u201cautonomous\u201d, within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention (see, among other authorities, K\u00f6nig v. Germany, judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, pp. 29-30, \u00a7\u00a7 88-89, and Baraona v. Portugal, judgment of 8 July 1987, Series A no. 122, pp. 17-18, \u00a7 42). The Court confirms this case-law in the instant case. It considers that any other solution is liable to lead to results that are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, K\u00f6nig, cited above, pp. 29-30, \u00a7 88, and Maaouia v. France [GC], no. 39652/98, \u00a7 34, ECHR 2000-X).\n\n25.\u00a0\u00a0Pecuniary interests are clearly at stake in tax proceedings, but merely showing that a dispute is \u201cpecuniary\u201d in nature is not in itself sufficient to attract the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its \u201ccivil\u201d head (see Pierre-Bloch v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-VI, p. 2223, \u00a7 51, and Pellegrin v. France [GC], \nno. 28541/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR 1999-VIII; cf. Editions P\u00e9riscope v. France, judgment of 26 March 1992, Series A no. 234-B, p. 66, \u00a7 40). In particular, according to the traditional case-law of the Convention institutions, \n\n\u201cThere may exist \u2018pecuniary\u2019 obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the State or its subordinate authorities which, for the purpose of Article 6 \u00a7 1, are to be considered as belonging exclusively to the realm of public law and are accordingly not covered by the notion of \u2018civil rights and obligations\u2019. Apart from fines imposed by way of \u2018criminal sanction\u2019, this will be the case, in particular, where an obligation which is pecuniary in nature derives from tax legislation or is otherwise part of normal civic duties in a democratic society\u201d. (See, among other authorities, Schouten and Meldrum v. the Netherlands, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 304, p. 21, \u00a7 50; Company S. and T. v. Sweden, no. 11189/84, Commission decision of 11 December 1986, Decisions and Reports (DR) 50, p. 121, at p. 140; and Kustannus oy Vapaa Ajattelija AB, Vapaa-Ajattelijain Liitto \u2013 Frit\u00e4nkarnas F\u00f6rbund r.y. and Kimmo Sundstr\u00f6m v. Finland, no. 20471/92, Commission decision of 15 April 1996, DR 85-A, p. 29, at \np. 46)\n\n26.\u00a0\u00a0The Convention is, however, a living instrument to be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions (see, among other authorities, Johnston and Others v. Ireland, judgment of 18 December 1986, Series A no. 112, pp. 24-25, \u00a7 53), and it is incumbent on the Court to review whether, in the light of changed attitudes in society as to the legal protection that falls to be accorded to individuals in their relations with the State, the scope of Article 6 \u00a7 1 should not be extended to cover disputes between citizens and public authorities as to the lawfulness under domestic law of the tax authorities\u2019 decisions. \n\n27.\u00a0\u00a0Relations between the individual and the State have clearly evolved in many spheres during the fifty years which have elapsed since the Convention was adopted, with State regulation increasingly intervening in private-law relations. This has led the Court to find that procedures classified under national law as being part of \u201cpublic law\u201d could come within the purview of Article 6 under its \u201ccivil\u201d head if the outcome was decisive for private rights and obligations, in regard to such matters as, to give some examples, the sale of land, the running of a private clinic, property interests, the granting of administrative authorisations relating to the conditions of professional practice or of a licence to serve alcoholic beverages (see, among other authorities, Ringeisen v. Austria, judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13, p. 39, \u00a7 94; K\u00f6nig, cited above, p. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95; Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52, p. 29, \u00a7 79; Allan Jacobsson v. Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 25 October 1989, Series A no. 163, pp. 20-21, \u00a7 73; Benthem v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 October 1985, Series A no. 97, p. 16, \u00a7 36; and Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 159, \np. 19, \u00a7 43). Moreover, the State\u2019s increasing intervention in the individual\u2019s day-to-day life, in terms of welfare protection for example, has required the Court to evaluate features of public law and private law before concluding that the asserted right could be classified as \u201ccivil\u201d (see, among other authorities, Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands, judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 99, p. 16, \u00a7 40; Deumeland v. Germany, judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 100, p. 25, \u00a7 74; Salesi v. Italy, judgment of 26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-E, pp. 59-60, \u00a7 19; and Schouten and Meldrum, cited above, p. 24, \u00a7 60).\n\n28.\u00a0\u00a0However, rights and obligations existing for an individual are not necessarily civil in nature. Thus, political rights and obligations, such as the right to stand for election to the National Assembly (see Pierre-Bloch, cited above, p. 2223, \u00a7 50), even though in those proceedings the applicant\u2019s pecuniary interests were at stake (ibid., \u00a7 51), are not civil in nature, with the consequence that Article 6 \u00a7 1 does not apply. Neither does that provision apply to disputes between administrative authorities and those of their employees who occupy posts involving participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law (see Pellegrin, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67). Similarly, the expulsion of aliens does not give rise to disputes (contestations) over civil rights for the purposes of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which accordingly does not apply (see Maaouia, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 37-38).\n\n29.\u00a0\u00a0In the tax field, developments which might have occurred in democratic societies do not, however, affect the fundamental nature of the obligation on individuals or companies to pay tax. In comparison with the position when the Convention was adopted, those developments have not entailed a further intervention by the State into the \u201ccivil\u201d sphere of the individual\u2019s life. The Court considers that tax matters still form part of the hard core of public-authority prerogatives, with the public nature of the relationship between the taxpayer and the community remaining predominant. Bearing in mind that the Convention and its Protocols must be interpreted as a whole, the Court also observes that Article 1 of Protocol \nNo. 1, which concerns the protection of property, reserves the right of States to enact such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose of securing the payment of taxes (see, mutatis mutandis, Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands, judgment of 23 February 1995, Series A \nno. 306-B, pp. 48-49, \u00a7 60). Although the Court does not attach decisive importance to that factor, it does take it into account. It considers that tax disputes fall outside the scope of civil rights and obligations, despite the pecuniary effects which they necessarily produce for the taxpayer.\n\n30.\u00a0\u00a0The principle according to which the autonomous concepts contained in the Convention must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions in democratic societies does not give the Court power to interpret Article 6 \u00a7 1 as though the adjective \u201ccivil\u201d (with the restriction that that adjective necessarily places on the category of \u201crights and obligations\u201d to which that Article applies) were not present in the text.\n\n31.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not apply in the instant case. \n\nII.\u00a0\u00a0THE COMPLAINT UNDER ARTICLE 14 OF THE CONVENTION\n\nAdmissibility\n\n32.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant also complained that he had been \u201cpersecuted by the Italian courts\u201d and relied on Article 14 of the Convention, which provides:\n\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\u201d\n\n33.\u00a0\u00a0The Court reiterates that discrimination is not forbidden by the Convention unless different measures are taken in respect of persons in comparable situations (see Case \u201crelating to certain aspects of the laws on the use of languages in education in Belgium\u201d, judgment of 23 July 1968, Series A no. 6, pp. 33-34, \u00a7\u00a7 9-10).\n\n34.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant has not explained how there has been an infringement of that provision. Accordingly, since this complaint has not been substantiated, the Court considers that there is no appearance of a violation of that provision and that the complaint must therefore be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded under Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Unanimously joins to the merits the Government\u2019s submission as to the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and, accordingly, declares admissible the complaint based on that Article;\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0Holds by eleven votes to six that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention does not apply in the instant case;\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0Declares inadmissible by sixteen votes to one the complaint under Article 14 of the Convention.\n\n\nDone in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 12 July 2001.\n\n\t\tLuzius Wildhaber\n\t\tPresident\n\tPaul Mahoney\n\tRegistrar\n\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0concurring opinion of Mr Ress;\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0dissenting opinion of Mr Lorenzen joined by Mr Rozakis, \nMr Bonello, Mrs Str\u00e1\u017enick\u00e1, Mr B\u00eersan and Mr Fischbach.\n\nL.W.\nP.J.M.\n\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE RESS\n\n(Translation)\n\nAs the Court has rightly stressed, the increasing intervention of the State in the individual\u2019s day-to-day life has required the Court to evaluate features of public law and private law before it could conclude that an asserted right could be classified as civil. Moreover, it was not the intrinsically public-law nature of proceedings for the expulsion of aliens which resulted in a ruling in Maaouia that Article 6 did not apply, but the existence of Protocol No. 7, and specifically Article 1 thereof, read in conjunction with the Convention itself (see Maaouia v. France [GC], no. 39652/98, \u00a7\u00a7 36-37, \nECHR 2000-X).\n\nThe Court found that developments in the tax field do not affect the fundamental nature of the obligation on individuals or companies to pay tax. However, there is an element in tax proceedings which might lead to a different result, at least in some cases. As the criminal aspects of tax cases are not excluded from the application of Article 6 (see Bendenoun \nv. France, judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284), I consider that the aspect of immediate enforcement, which presents similarities with the effect of penalties and can be even more severe from an economic point of view, should not be excluded a priori from the scope of application of Article 6. \n\nEven if tax matters, at least generally speaking, still form part of the hard core of public-authority prerogatives, there is an aspect in which the State transgresses those prerogatives and enters a sphere in which the individual should, in a democratic society, be able to challenge such a duty on the taxpayer by arguing that there has been an abuse of rights in immediate enforcement proceedings. In the same way as the Court has established an obligation in respect of penalties not to proceed to enforcement before the individual has had the possibility of having the lawfulness reviewed, that aspect seems to me to be also valid in respect of tax proceedings. If the procedure in tax cases in some Contracting States does not provide for a stay of proceedings where the individual disputes his obligation to pay or does not at least give him the possibility of requesting a stay of execution before paying sometimes considerable amounts, the lawfulness of which is disputed, the State is using the predominant position conferred on it by its sovereign prerogatives in a manner which might be deemed excessive. That may also be the case if the State requests, in the event of a stay of enforcement, bank guarantees imposing an excessive burden on the individual. \n\nIf account is taken of the sometimes very lengthy tax proceedings before tax authorities and courts dealing with tax cases, the taxpayer is left in a position which one would be hard pressed to describe as \u201cpart of the normal civic obligations in a democratic society\u201d (see Schouten and Meldrum v. the Netherlands, judgment of 9 December 1994, Series A no. 304, p. 21, \u00a7 50). That is a factor which might, in my opinion, induce the Court to review certain aspects of the application of Article 6 in taxation cases. \n\nOn the basis of the information produced, that aspect is not decisive in Ferrazzini because, after receiving the supplementary tax assessment of 31\u00a0August 1987, the applicant did not pay the difference in tax due between 1987 and 1998 when the Tax Commission struck the case out of the list. Similarly, with regard to the two applications lodged by A., that company has not yet paid the money allegedly due following the supplementary tax assessment of 16 November 1987. That is probably due to the fact that, under Italian law, Article 47 of Legislative Decree no. 546 of 31 December 1992 provides for a stay of enforcement if serious and irreparable damage might otherwise ensue.\n\nDISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE LORENZEN \nJOINED BY JUDGES ROZAKIS, BONELLO, \nSTR\u00c1\u017dNICK\u00c1, B\u00ceRSAN AND FISCHBACH\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0The present case raises the important issue whether Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention under its civil head is applicable to proceedings concerning tax assessments. So far the majority has confirmed the case-law of the Convention institutions, which have constantly held that not to be the case. I am not able to share the opinion of the majority for the reasons stated below.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0The Convention does not contain any definition of what is meant by \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d. Even if the Convention institutions have ruled on this issue several times over the years and more than once revised earlier case-law, such a definition is not to be found in the case-law. The Convention institutions have ruled on the applicability of Article 6 in that respect on a case-by-case basis, although some important general elements have been identified.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0In order to understand the present case-law and the possible need to revise it, it is in my opinion essential to recall the historical background for introducing the concept \u201ccivil\u201d into Article 6 \u00a7 1 \u2013 a concept which is not found in the English text of the corresponding Article 14 of The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 8 of the American Convention on Human Rights, on the contrary, expressly covers tax disputes (\u201crights and obligations of a civil, labour, fiscal or any other nature\u201d). \n\nThe travaux pr\u00e9paratoires relating to Article 6 of the Convention \u2013 closely linked to those of Article 14 of the Covenant \u2013 demonstrate in my opinion the following: (1) it was the intention of the drafters to exclude disputes between individuals and governments on a more general basis mainly owing to difficulties at that time in making a precise division of powers between, on the one hand, administrative bodies exercising discretionary powers and, on the other hand, judicial bodies; (2) no specific reference was made to taxation matters, which are normally not based on a discretion but on the application of more or less precise legal rules; (3) the exclusion of the applicability of Article 6 should be followed by a more detailed study of the problems relating to \u201cthe exercise of justice in the relations between individuals and governments\u201d; accordingly, (4) it seems not to have been the intention of the drafters that disputes in the field of \nadministration should be excluded forever from the scope of applicability of \n\nArticle 6 \u00a7 1 (see, for a detailed analysis, paragraphs 19 to 22 of the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Ryssdal, Bindschedler-Robert, Lagergren, Matscher, Sir Vincent Evans, Bernhardt and Gersing in Deumeland \nv. Germany, judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 100, pp. 38-39, and the concurring opinion of Mr Sperduti in Salesi v. Italy (judgment of \n26 February 1993, Series A no. 257-E, opinion of the Commission, pp. 67-70).\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Against that background it is understandable that the Convention institutions, in the first years after the Convention came into force, applied Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its civil head on a restrictive basis in respect of disputes between individuals and governments. On the other hand, it is hard to accept that the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, dating more than fifty years back and partly based on preconditions that have not been fulfilled or are no longer relevant should remain a permanent obstacle to a reasonable development of the case-law concerning the scope of Article 6 \u2013 in particular in areas where there is an obvious need to extend the protection granted by that Article to individuals. The present case-law clearly demonstrates in fact that the Convention institutions have not felt bound to maintain a restrictive attitude, but have extended the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to a considerable number of relationships between individuals and governments, which originally must have been held to be excluded.\n\nThe following examples could be mentioned to illustrate what disputes between individuals and governments the Court has so far held to be covered by the civil head of Article 6:\n\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning expropriation, planning decisions, building permits and, more generally, decisions which interfere with the use or the enjoyment of property (see, for example, Sporrong L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden, judgment of 23 September 1982, Series A no. 52; Ettl and Others v. Austria, Erkner and Hofauer v. Austria, and Poiss v. Austria, judgments of 23 April 1987, Series A no. 117; H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden, judgment of 21 February 1990, Series A no. 171-A; and Mats Jacobsson v. Sweden and Sk\u00e4rby v. Sweden, judgments of 28 June 1990, Series A no. 180-A and B);\n\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning a permit, licence or other act of a public authority, which forms a condition for the legality of a contract between private persons (see, for example, Ringeisen v. Austria, judgment of 16 July 1971, Series A no. 13);\n\n(c)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning the grant or revocation of a licence by a public authority which is required in order to carry out certain economic activities (see, for example, Benthem v. the Netherlands, judgment of \n23 October 1985, Series A no. 97; Pudas v. Sweden, judgment of \n27 October 1987, Series A no. 125-A; Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 159; and Fredin v. Sweden (no. 1), judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 192);\n\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning the cancellation or suspension by a public authority of the right to practise a particular profession, etc. (see, for example, K\u00f6nig v. Germany, judgment of 28 June 1978, Series A no. 27, and Diennet v. France, judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A \nno. 325-A);\n\n(e)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning damages in administrative proceedings (see, for example, Editions P\u00e9riscope v. France, judgment of 26 March 1992, Series A no. 234-B);\n\n(f)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning the obligation to pay contributions to a public security scheme (see, for example, Feldbrugge v. the Netherlands, judgment of 29 May 1986, Series A no. 99, and Deumeland, cited above);\n\n(g)\u00a0\u00a0proceedings concerning disputes in the context of employment in the civil service, if \u201ca purely economic right\u201d was asserted, for instance the level of salary, and \u201cadministrative authorities\u2019 discretionary powers were not in issue\u201d (see, for instance, De Santa v. Italy, judgment of 2 September 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-V). If, on the other hand, \u201cthe economic aspect\u201d was dependent on the prior finding of an unlawful act or based on the exercise of discretionary powers, Article 6 was held not to be applicable (see, for instance, Spurio v. Italy, judgment of 2 September 1997, Reports 1997-V). In this respect the case-law of the Court has later been changed (see point 6 below on the judgment of 8 December 1999 in Pellegrin v. France).\n\nIt is true, however, \u2013 as stressed by the majority \u2013 that in other situations the Court has held that Article 6 is not applicable to disputes between individuals and governments, (see, inter alia, Pierre-Bloch v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997-VI, p. 2223, concerning the right to stand for election, and Maaouia v. France, no. 39652/98, ECHR 2000-X, concerning decisions regarding the entry, stay and deportation of aliens).\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0One may raise the question whether it is at all possible to draw any clear and convincing dividing line between \u201ccivil\u201d and \u201cnon-civil\u201d rights and obligations based on the Court\u2019s present case-law, and, if not, whether the time has come to end that uncertainty by extending the protection under Article 6 \u00a7 1 to all cases in which a determination by a public authority of the legal position of a private party is at stake (see, for such a solution, inter alia, Van Dijk and Van Hoof, Theory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights, 3rd ed., 1998, p. 406).\n\nThis would be a rather far-reaching step that would considerably reduce the independent content of the concept \u201ccivil\u201d, which would then become merely a cover for all cases not belonging to the criminal head. In my opinion the case-law of the Court so far does not support the conclusion that such a radical step is the only way to overcome uncertainty as to the scope of applicability of Article 6. However, as long as a dividing line between \u201ccivil\u201d and \u201cnon-civil\u201d rights and obligations is maintained in respect of proceedings between individuals and governments, it is important to ensure that the relevant criteria for determining what is \u201ccivil\u201d are applied in a logical and reasonable manner \u2013 and that may make it necessary from time to time to adjust the case-law in order to make it consistent in the light of recent developments.\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0There can be no doubt that a central factor for the Court, when ruling on the \u201ccivil\u201d character of rights and obligations, has been whether the pecuniary interests of the individual have been at stake in the proceedings. Thus in Editions P\u00e9riscope, cited above, the Court noted that the subject matter of the action was \u201cpecuniary\u201d in nature and founded on an infringement of rights which were likewise pecuniary rights. The Court found that the right in question \u201cwas therefore a \u2018civil right\u2019, notwithstanding the origin of the dispute ...\u201d. The pecuniary aspect has been stressed in many other judgments \u2013 even in situations where the background of the dispute was clearly fiscal. Thus, in National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 23 October 1997, Reports 1997-VII), the Court held proceedings to attain restitution of monies paid under invalidated tax provisions to be \u201ccivil\u201d with reference to the pecuniary aspect and added: \u201cThis conclusion is not affected by the fact that the rights asserted in those proceedings had their background in tax legislation and the obligation of the applicant societies to account for tax under that legislation\u201d (p. 2379, \u00a7 97).\n\nIt is true that the Court has stated in other judgments that proceedings do not become \u201ccivil\u201d merely because they raise an economic issue (see, for example, Schouten and Meldrum v. the Netherlands, judgment of \n9 December 1994, Series A no. 304, p. 21, \u00a7 50; Pierre-Bloch, cited above, p. 2223, \u00a7 51; and Pellegrin v. France [GC], no. 28541/95, \u00a7 60, ECHR \n1999-VIII). In the first of those judgments the Court \u2013 in an obiter dictum \u2013 considered the civil head of Article 6 inapplicable if rights and obligations \u201cderive from tax legislation or [are] otherwise part of normal civic duties in a democratic society\u201d (emphasis added). In the later judgments the Court has not \u2013 at least not expressly \u2013 relied on that general criterion: in Pierre-Bloch the Court simply said that the right to stand for election was \u201ca political one and not a \u2018civil\u2019 one\u201d and that it was not in itself decisive that the proceedings also had an economic aspect for the applicant as that aspect formed part of the arrangements for the exercise of the right in question. In Pellegrin the Court realised that the \u201ceconomic\u201d criterion applied so far had proved not to be suitable to determine the applicability of Article 6 \u00a7 1 to disputes between States and their servants. However, the Court did not rely on another general-purpose criterion, but adopted a specific one in such cases. In Maaouia the Court\u2019s majority did not apply the criterion established in Schouten and Meldrum either, but held that Article 6 \u00a7 1 was inapplicable on the basis of an interpretation of the intentions behind \nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 7.\n\nIn my opinion the criterion \u201cnormal civic duties in a democratic society\u201d is not suitable to form the basis for a general distinction between \u201ccivil\u201d and \u201cnon-civil\u201d rights and obligations. Thus it is difficult to see why, for example, the obligation to hand over property for public use in return for compensation is not a \u201cnormal civic duty\u201d whereas the obligation to tolerate tax-based reductions of the compensation is. How can it be explained that the right to obtain tax concessions and preferential postal charges is not \u201ccivil\u201d, but that a claim for compensation for alleged failure to grant such concessions is? Or how can it be explained that an obligation to pay contributions under a social security scheme is \u201ccivil\u201d, but an obligation to pay income tax is not? (see, Van Dijk and Van Hoof, cited above, p. 406).\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0At least when the pecuniary interests of an individual are directly affected and the interference is not based on the exercise of discretionary powers, the economic criterion established in Editions P\u00e9riscope and other judgments should still be the starting-point. However, exceptions must be accepted when they are justified by special circumstances. This has been the case in respect of the right to stand for elections because of its political character (see Pierre-Bloch), in respect of the relations between States and their servants (see Pellegrin) and in respect of the right of aliens to enter and stay in a country (see Maaouia).\n\nIt is not open to doubt that the obligation to pay taxes directly and substantially affects the pecuniary interests of citizens and that, in a democratic society, taxation (its base, payment and collection as opposed to litigation under budgetary law) is based on the application of legal rules and not on the authorities\u2019 discretion. Accordingly, in my view Article 6 should apply to such disputes unless there are special circumstances justifying the conclusion that the obligation to pay taxes should not be considered \u201ccivil\u201d under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0The majority considers that in the field of taxation there have been no major developments concerning the nature of the obligations of individuals and companies compared with the situation at the time of the drafting of the Convention. Accordingly, the majority is of the opinion that taxation still belongs to the \u201chard core of public-authority prerogatives, with the public nature of the relationship between the taxpayer and the community remaining predominant\u201d. The majority also takes into account that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 reserves the right of States to enact such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose of securing the payment of taxes.\n\nI am not convinced by that reasoning.\n\nThe finding that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention under its civil head is applicable to tax cases does not in any way restrict the States\u2019 power to place whatever fiscal obligations they wish on individuals and companies. Nor does such a finding restrict the States\u2019 freedom to enforce any such laws as they deem necessary in order to secure the payment of taxes (see Article 1 of Protocol No. 1). Article 6 of the Convention is a procedural guarantee that grants primarily the right of access to a court and the right to have court proceedings determined fairly within a reasonable time. In that respect there have in fact been important developments in the field of taxation since the drafting of the Convention. Whereas at that time it was doubtful in some legal systems to what extent administrative decisions in fiscal matters could be reviewed by a court \u2013 if at all \u2013 it is now recognised, at least in the vast majority of the Contracting Parties, that disputes in fiscal matters can be decided in ordinary proceedings by a court or a tribunal. It is therefore difficult to see why it is still necessary to grant the States a special prerogative under the Convention in this field and thus deny litigants in tax proceedings the elementary procedural guarantees of Article 6 \u00a7 1. As demonstrated, inter alia, in the concurring opinion of Judge Ress, there is a clear need to grant such protection \u2013 not least against lengthy proceedings combined with an obligation to pay taxes before a dispute concerning the legality of the tax decision is finally settled. In my opinion there is no basis in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 for the assumption that the intention was to grant States the right to deny individuals any procedural protection in disputes on tax matters. How might it be justifiable to exempt from the Court\u2019s scrutiny the procedural rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 in respect of a dispute whose substance is directly linked to a civil right (in this case the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions)? Such an interpretation would also be contrary to the constantly developing case-law of the Court according to which substantive Articles of the Convention, such as Articles 2, 3 and 8, must be interpreted as also implying procedural obligations on States.\n\nFurthermore, it is difficult to justify that an extended application of Article 6 \u00a7 1 under its civil head is not possible on grounds of the need to preserve a prerogative for States in fiscal matters, when the Court has gone sufficiently far in its case-law to include tax disputes under its criminal head. Since Bendenoun v. France (judgment of 24 February 1994, Series A no. 284), the Court has consistently considered proceedings relating to tax disputes to be \u201ccriminal\u201d if tax fines, surcharges, etc., with a deterrent and punitive purpose are imposed or even if there is a risk that they may be imposed (see, most recently, J.B. v. Switzerland, no. 31827/96, ECHR 2001-III). The result is no different if the proceedings also concern the tax assessment as such (see the admissibility decision of 16 May 2000 in Georgiou v. the United Kingdom, no. 40042/98, unreported). This implies that the level of protection under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention varies depending on how the legal framework for tax proceedings is organised in the different legal systems; and even within one legal system it may be purely a matter of coincidence whether penalty proceedings and tax assessment proceedings are joined or not. An interpretation of the Convention that leads to such random results is far from satisfactory.\n\n9. For the above reasons, I conclude that there are no convincing arguments for maintaining the present case-law of the Court that proceedings regarding taxation do not determine \u201ccivil rights and obligations\u201d for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. Accordingly, I find that Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention is applicable in the instant case."}
